Preface

The Rust programming language is an exciting new language. It gives us memory safety
without garbage collection, resulting in fast times and low memory footprints. However,
rewriting everything in Rust can be expensive and risky as there might not be package
support in Rust for the problem being solved. This is where Python bindings and pip
come in. This book will enable you to code modules in Rust that can be installed using
pip. As a result, you will be able to inject Rust as and when you need it without taking on
the risk and workload of rewriting your entire system. This enables you, as a developer, to
experiment with and use Rust in your Python projects.

Who this book is for
Python developers who want to speed up their code with Rust, or experiment with
Rust without having to take on much risk or workload, will benefit from this book.
No background in Rust is needed. This book has an introduction to Rust for Python
developers, and uses Python examples to get you up to speed with Rust quickly.

What this book covers
Chapter 1, An Introduction to Rust from a Python Perspective, covers the basics of Rust to
enable Rust development. Relevant Python examples are given to help you grasp the Rust
concepts examined.

Chapter 2, Structuring Code in Rust, explains how to structure Rust programs over
multiple pages and use package management tools to organize and install dependencies.

Chapter 3, Understanding Concurrency, covers how to multithread and multiprocess in
Rust, seeing as Rust has "fearless concurrency." We also cover concurrency in Python to
see the differences.

Chapter 4, Building pip Modules in Python, sees us build Python packages that can be
installed using pip. It also covers how packages can be hosted privately on GitHub.

Chapter 5, Creating a Rust Interface for Our pip Module, has us inject Rust into our pip
module and use the Rust setup tools to compile and use the Rust code in our Python code.

xiv     Preface

Chapter 6, Working with Python Objects in Rust, considers how compatibility does not just
go in one direction. In this chapter, we take in Python objects and interact with them. We
also create Python objects in Rust.

Chapter 7, Using Python Modules in Rust, builds on the previous chapter and sees us use
Python modules such as NumPy in our Rust code.

Chapter 8, Structuring an End-to-End Python Module in Rust, sees us wrapping up
everything that has been covered into a fully functioning Python package written in Rust.
This package has Python interfaces and command-line functionality that accepts YAML
files for configuration.

Chapter 9, Structuring a Python Flask App for Rust, has us build a Python Flask app with
a PostgreSQL database, NGINX load balancer, and Celery worker in order to get more
practical with our Rust skills. All of this is wrapped in Docker to prepare us for injecting
Rusk into all of these aspects of the web application.

Chapter 10, Injecting Rust into a Python Flask App, covers how to take the web application
that we built in the previous chapter and inject our Rust modules into the Docker
containers for the Celery worker and Flask application. We also imprint the migrations
that have already been applied to automatically generate a schema of the database so our
Rust code can directly connect with the database.

Chapter 11, Best Practices for Integrating Rust, concludes the book with some tips on how
to avoid common mistakes as you continue to write Rust code for Python.

To get the most out of this book
It is advisable that you understand Python and are comfortable with object-Oriented
programming. Some advanced topics such as meta-classing will be touched on but are not
essential. Rust programming, Python web apps, and Python modules installed using pip
are all covered in the book.

If you are using the digital version of this book, we advise you to type the code yourself
or access the code from the book's GitHub repository (a link is available in the next
section). Doing so will help you avoid any potential errors related to the copying and
pasting of code.

Section 1:
Getting to
Understand Rust

In this section, we will get to grips with Rust. Instead of introducing the basics of Rust,
such as loops and functions, we will cover the syntax specific to Rust. After this, we will
explore the quirks that the Rust language introduces, primarily centered around memory
management. We will then cover how to manage dependencies and structure our code
over multiple files. After this, we will experiment with multithreading and multiprocessing
in Rust and Python.

This section comprises the following chapters:

•  Chapter 1, An Introduction to Rust from a Python Perspective

•  Chapter 2, Structuring Code in Rust

•  Chapter 3, Understanding Concurrency

1
An Introduction to
Rust from a Python
Perspective

Due to its speed and safety, it is no surprise that Rust is the new language gaining in
popularity. However, with success comes criticism. Despite Rust's popularity as an
impressive language, it has also gained the label of being hard to learn, an idea which
isn't quite grounded in reality.

In this chapter, we will cover all of Rust's quirks that will be new to a Python developer. If
Python is your main language, concepts such as basic memory management and typing
can initially slow down your ability to quickly write productive Rust code due to the
compiler failing to compile the code. However, this can quickly be overcome by learning
the rules around Rust features, such as variable ownership, lifetimes, and so on, as Rust
is a memory-safe language. Consequently, we must keep track of our variables as they
usually get deleted instantly when they go out of scope. If this does not make sense yet,
don't worry; we will cover this concept in the Keeping track of scopes and lifetimes section.

4     An Introduction to Rust from a Python Perspective

In this chapter, we will also be covering the basics of syntax, while you will be setting
up a Rust environment on your own computer in the next chapter. Do not worry though,
you can code all the examples in this chapter on the free online Rust playground.

In particular, we will cover the following topics in this chapter:

•  Understanding the differences between Python and Rust

•  Understanding variable ownership

•  Keeping track of scopes and lifetimes

•  Building structs as opposed to objects

•  Metaprogramming with macros instead of decorators

Technical requirements
As this is just an introduction, all the Python examples in the chapter can be implemented
with a free online Python interpreter such as https://replit.com/languages/
python3.

The same goes for all the Rust examples. These can be implemented using the free online
Rust playground found at https://play.rust-lang.org/.

Understanding the differences between Python and Rust     5

Understanding the differences between
Python and Rust
Rust can sometimes be described as a systems language. As a result, it can sometimes
be labeled by software engineers in a way that is similar to C++: fast, hard to learn,
dangerous, and time-consuming to code in. As a result, most of you mainly working
in dynamic languages such as Python could be put off. However, Rust is memory-
safe, efficient, and productive. Once we have gotten over some of the quirks that Rust
introduces, nothing is holding you back from exploiting Rust's advantages by using it to
write fast, safe, and efficient code. Seeing as there are so many advantages to Rust, we will
explore them in the next section.

Why fuse Python with Rust?
When it comes to picking a language, there is usually a trade-off between resources, speed,
and development time. Dynamic languages such as Python became popular as computing
power increased. We were able to use the extra resources we had to manage our memory
with garbage collectors. As a result, developing software became easier, quicker, and safer.
As we will cover later in the Keeping track of scopes and lifetimes section, poor memory
management can lead to some security flaws. The exponential increase in computing
power over the years is known as Moore's Law. However, this is not continuing to hold
and in 2019, Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang suggested that as chip components get closer to
the size of individual atoms, it has gotten harder to keep up with the pace of Moore's Law,
thus declaring it dead (https://www.cnet.com/news/moores-law-is-dead-
nvidias-ceo-jensen-huang-says-at-ces-2019/).

6     An Introduction to Rust from a Python Perspective

However, with the rise of big data, our need to pick up faster languages to satisfy our
needs is increasing. This is where languages such as Golang and Rust enter. These
languages are memory-safe, yet they compile and have significant speed increases. What
makes Rust even more unique is that it has managed to achieve memory safety without
garbage collection. To appreciate this, let's briefly describe garbage collection: this is
where the program temporarily stops, checks all the variables to see which ones are no
longer being used, and deletes those that are not. Considering that Rust does not have to
do this, it is a significant advantage as Rust does not have to keep stopping to clean up the
variables. This was demonstrated in Discord's 2020 blog post Why Discord is switching
from Go to Rust: https://blog.discord.com/why-discord-is-switching-
from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f#:~:text=The%20service%20we%20
switched%20from,is%20in%20the%20hot%20path. In this post, we can see that
Golang just could not keep up with Rust, as demonstrated in the graph they presented:

Figure 1.1 – Golang is spiky and Rust is the flat line below Golang
(image source: https://blog.discord.com/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-
a190bbca2b1f#:~:text=The%20service%20we%20switched%20from,is%20in%20the%20hot%20path)

The comments on the post were full of people complaining that Discord used an
out-of-date version of Golang. Discord responded to this by stating that they tried
a range of Golang versions, and they all had similar results. With this, it makes sense
to get the best of both worlds without much compromise. We can use Python for
prototyping and complex logic. The extensive range of third-party libraries that Python
has combined with the flexible object-oriented programming it supports make it an ideal
language for solving real-world problems. However, it's slow and is not efficient with the
use of resources. This is where we reach for Rust.

Understanding the differences between Python and Rust     7

Rust is a bit more restrictive in the way we can lay out and structure the code; however,
it's fast, safe, and efficient when implementing multithreading. Combining these two
languages enables a Python developer to have a powerful tool in their belt that their
Python code can use when needed. The time investment needed to learn and fuse Rust
is low. All we must do is package Rust and install it in our Python system using pip and
understand a few quirks that Rust has that are different from Python. We can start this
journey by looking at how Rust handles strings in the next section. However, before we
explore strings, we have to first understand how Rust is run compared to Python.

If you have built a web app in Python using Flask, you will have seen multiple tutorials
sporting the following code:

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Hello, World!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

What we must note here is the last two lines of the code. Everything above that defines
a basic Flask web app and a route. However, the running of the app in the last two lines
only executes if the Python interpreter is directly running the file. This means that other
Python files can import the Flask app from this file without running it. This is referred to
by many as an entry point.

You import everything you need in this file, and for the application to run, we get our
interpreter to run this script. We can nest any code under the if __name__ ==
"__main__": line of code. It will not run unless the file is directly hit by the Python
interpreter. Rust has a similar concept. However, this is more essential, as opposed to
Python that just has it as a nice-to-have feature. In the Rust playground (see the Technical
requirements section), we can type in the following code if it is not there already:

fn main() {
    println!("hello world");
}

8     An Introduction to Rust from a Python Perspective

This is the entry point. The Rust program gets compiled, and then runs the main
function. If whatever you've coded is not accessed by the main function, it will never run.
Here, we are already getting a sense of the safety enforced by Rust. We will see more of this
throughout the book.

Now that we have our program running, we can move on to understanding the difference
between Rust and Python when it comes to strings.

Passing strings in Rust
In Python, strings are flexible. We can pretty much do what we want with them. While
technically, Python strings cannot be changed under the hood, in Python syntax, we can
chop and change them, pass them anywhere, and convert them into integers or floats
(if permitted) without having to think too much about it. We can do all of this with Rust
too. However, we must plan beforehand what we are going to do. To demonstrate this,
we can dive right in by making our own print function and calling it, as seen in the
following code:

fn print(input: str) {
    println!("{}", input);
}
fn main() {
    print("hello world");
}

In Python, a similar program would work. However, when we run it in the Rust
playground, we get the following error:

error[E0277]: the size for values of type 'str' cannot be known
at compilation time

This is because we cannot specify what the maximum size is. We don't get this in Python;
therefore, we must take a step back and understand how variables are assigned in memory.
When the code compiles, it allocates memory for different variables in the stack. When
the code runs, it stores data in the heap. Strings can be various sizes so we cannot be
sure at compile time how much memory we can allocate to the input parameter of our
function when compiling. What we are passing in is a string slice. We can remedy this by
passing in a string and converting our string literal to a string before passing it into our
function as seen here:

fn print(input: String) {
    println!("{}", input);

Understanding the differences between Python and Rust     9

}
fn main() {
    let string_literal = "hello world";
    print(string_literal.to_string());
}

Here, we can see that we have used the to_string() function to convert our string
literal into a string. To understand why String is accepted, we need to understand
what a string is.

A string is a type of wrapper implemented as a vector of bytes. This vector holds a
reference to a string slice in the heap memory. It then holds the amount of data available
to the pointer, and the length of the string literal. For instance, if we have a string of the
string literal one, it can be denoted by the following diagram:

Figure 1.2 – String relationship to str

Considering this, we can understand why we can guarantee the size of String when
we pass it into our function. It will always be a pointer to the string literal with some
meta-information about the string literal. If we can just make a reference to the string
literal, we can pass this into our function as it is just a reference and we can therefore
guarantee that the size of the reference will stay the same. This can be done by borrowing
using the & operator as shown in the following code:

fn print(input_string: &str) {
    println!("{}", input_string);
}
fn main() {

10     An Introduction to Rust from a Python Perspective

    let test_string = &"Hello, World!";
    print(test_string);
}

We will cover the concept of borrowing later in the chapter but, for now, we understand
that, unlike Python, we must guarantee the size of the variable being passed into a
function. We can use borrowing and wrappers such as strings to handle this. It may not
come as a surprise, but this does not just stop at strings. Considering this, we can move on
to the next section to understand the differences between Python and Rust when it comes
to floats and integers.

Sizing up floats and integers in Rust
Like strings, Python manages floats and integers with ease and simplicity. We can pretty
much do whatever we want with them. For instance, the following Python code will
result in 6.5:

result = 1 + 2.2
result = result + 3.3

However, there is a problem when we try to just execute the first line in Rust with the
following line of Rust code:

let result = 1 + 2.2;

It results in an error telling us that a float cannot be added to an integer. This error
highlights one of the pain points that Python developers go through when learning Rust,
as Rust enforces typing aggressively by refusing to compile if typing is not present and
consistent. However, while this is an initial pain, aggressive typing does help in the long
run as it maintains safety.

Type annotation in Python is gaining popularity. This is where the type of the variable
is declared for parameters of functions or variables declared, enabling some editors
to highlight when the types are inconsistent. The same happens in JavaScript with
TypeScript. We can replicate the Python code at the start of this section with the following
Rust code:

let mut result = 1.0 + 2.2;
result = result + 3.3;

Understanding the differences between Python and Rust     11

It has to be noted that the result variable must be declared as a mutable variable with
the mut notation. Mutable means that the variable can be changed. This is because Rust
automatically assigns all variables as immutable unless we use the mut notation.

Now that we have seen the effects of types and mutability, we should really explore
integers and floats. Rust has two types of integers: signed integers, which are denoted by
i, and unsigned integers, denoted by u. Unsigned integers only house positive numbers,
whereas signed integers house positive and negative integers. This does not just stop here.
In Rust, we can also denote the size of the integer that is allowed. This can be calculated
by using binary. Now, understanding how to use binary notation to describe numbers in
detail is not really needed. However, understanding the simple rule that the size can be
calculated by raising two to the power of the number of bits can give us an understanding
of how big an integer is allowed to be. We can calculate all the integer sizes that we can
utilize in Rust with the following table:

Table 1.1 – Size of integer types

As we can see, we can get to very high numbers here. However, it is not the best idea to
assign all variables and parameters as u128 integers. This is because the compiler will
set aside this amount of memory each time when compiling. This is not very efficient
considering that it's unlikely that we will be using such large numbers. It must be noted
that the changes in each jump are so large it is pointless graphing it. Each jump in bits
completely overshadows all the others, resulting in a flat line along the x axis and a
huge spike at the last graphed number of bits. However, we also must be sure that our
assignment is not too small. We can demonstrate this with the Rust code as follows:

let number: u8 = 255;
let breaking_number: u8 = 256;

Our compiler will be OK with the number variable. However, it will throw the error
shown next when assigning the breaking_number variable:

literal '256' does not fit into the type 'u8' whose range
is '0..=255'

12     An Introduction to Rust from a Python Perspective

This is because there are 256 integers between 0 -> 255, as we include 0. We can change
our unsigned integer to a signed one with the following line of Rust code:

let number: i8 = 255;

This gives us the following error:

literal '255' does not fit into the type 'i8' whose range
is '-128..=127'

In this error, we are reminded that the bits are are allocated memory space. Therefore,
an i8 integer must accommodate positive and negative integers within the same number
of bits. As a result, we can only support a magnitude that is half of the integer of an
unsigned integer.

When it comes to floats, our choices are more limited. Here, Rust accommodates both
f32 and f64 floating points. Declaring these floating-point variables requires the same
syntax as integers:

let float: f32 = 20.6;

It must be noted that we can also annotate numbers with suffixes, as shown in the
following code:

let x = 1u8;

Here, x has a value of 1 with the type of u8. Now that we have covered floats and integers,
we can use vectors and arrays to store them.

Managing data in Rust's vectors and arrays
With Python, we have lists. We can stuff anything we want into these lists with the
append function and these lists are, by default, mutable. Python tuples are technically
not lists, but we can treat them as immutable arrays. With Rust, we have arrays and
vectors. Arrays are the most basic of the two. Defining and looping through an array is
straightforward in Rust, as we can see in the following code:

let array: [i32; 3] = [1, 2, 3];

println!("array has {} elements", array.len());

for i in array.iter() {

Understanding the differences between Python and Rust     13

    println!("{}", i);
}

If we try and append another integer onto our array with the push function, we will not
be able to even if the array is mutable. If we add a fourth element to our array definition
that is not an integer, the program will refuse to compile as all of the elements in the array
have to be the same. However, this is not entirely true.

Later in this chapter, we will cover structs. In Python, the closest comparison to objects
is structs as they have their own attributes and functions. Structs can also have traits,
which we will also discuss later. In terms of Python, the closest comparison to traits is
mixins. Therefore, a range of structs can be housed in an array if they all have the same
trait in common. When looping through the array, the compiler will only allow us to
execute functions from that trait as this is all we can ensure will be consistent throughout
the array.

The same rules in terms of type or trait consistency also apply to vectors. However, vectors
place their memory on the heap and are expandable. Like everything in Rust, they are, by
default, immutable. However, applying the mut tag will enable us to add and manipulate
the vector. In the following code, we define a vector, print the length of the vector, append
another element to the vector, and then loop through the vector printing all elements:

let mut str_vector: Vec<&str> = vec!["one", "two", \
  "three"];

println!("{}", str_vector.len());

str_vector.push("four");

for i in str_vector.iter() {
    println!("{}", i);
}

This gives us the following output:

3
one
two
three
four

14     An Introduction to Rust from a Python Perspective

We can see that our append worked.

Considering the rules about consistency, vectors and arrays might seem a little restrictive
to a Python developer. However, if they are, sit back and ask yourself why. Why would you
want to put in a range of elements that do not have any consistency? Although Python
allows you to do this, how could you loop through a list with inconsistent elements and
confidently perform operations on them without crashing the program?

With this in mind, we are starting to see the benefits and safety behind this restrictive
typing system. There are some ways in which we can put in different elements that are not
structs bound by the same trait. Considering this, we will explore how we can store and
access our varied data elements via hashmaps in Rust in the next section.

Replacing dictionaries with hashmaps
Hashmaps in Rust are essentially dictionaries in Python. However, unlike our previous
vectors and arrays, we want to have a range of different data types housed in a hashmap
(although we can also do this with vectors and arrays). To achieve this, we can use Enums.
Enums are, well, Enums, and we have the exact same concept in Python. However, instead
of it being an Enum, we merely have a Python object that inherits the Enum object as seen
in the following code:

from enum import Enum

class Animal(Enum):
    STRING = "string"
    INT = "int"

Here, we can use the Enum to save us from using raw strings in our Python code when
picking a particular category. With a code editor known as an IDE, this is very useful, but
it's understandable if a Python developer has never used them as they are not enforced
anywhere. Not using them makes the code more prone to mistakes and harder to maintain
when categories change and so on, but there is nothing in Python stopping the developer
from just using a raw string to describe an option. In Rust, we are going to want our
hashmap to accept strings and integers. To do this, we are going to have to carry out the
following steps:

1.  Create an Enum to handle multiple data types.

2.  Create a new hashmap and insert values belonging to the Enum we created in step 1.

3.  Test the data consistency by looping through the hashmap and match all possible

outcomes.

Understanding the differences between Python and Rust     15

4.  Build a function that processes data extracted from the hashmap.

5.  Use the function to process outcomes from getting a value from the hashmap.

Therefore, we are going to create an Enum that houses this using the following code:

enum Value {
    Str(&'static str),
    Int(i32),
}

Here, we can see that we have introduced the statement 'static. This denotes a lifetime
and basically states that the reference remains for the rest of the program's lifetime. We
will cover lifetimes in the Keeping track of scopes and lifetimes section.

Now that we have defined our Enum, we can build our own mutable hashmap and insert
an integer and a string into it with the following code:

use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut map = HashMap::new();

map.insert("one", Value::Str("1"));
map.insert("two", Value::Int(2));

Now that our hashmap is housing a single type that houses the two types we defined, we
must handle them.

Remember, Rust has strong typing. Unlike Python, Rust will not allow us to compile
unsafe code (Rust can compile in an unsafe context but this is not default behavior). We
must handle every possible outcome, otherwise the compiler will refuse to compile. We
can do this with a match statement as seen in the following code:

for (_key, value) in &map {

    match value {
        Value::Str(inside_value) => {
            println!("the following value is an str: {}", \
                inside_value);
        }
        Value::Int(inside_value) => {
            println!("the following value is an int: {}", \

16     An Introduction to Rust from a Python Perspective

                inside_value);
        }
    }
}

In this code sample, we have looped through a borrowed reference to the hashmap using
&. Again, we will cover borrowing later on in the Understanding variable ownership
section. We prefix the key with a _. This is telling the compiler that we are not going
to use the key. We don't have to do this as the compiler will still compile the code;
however, it will complain by issuing a warning. The value that we are retrieving from
the hashmap is our Value Enum. In this match statement, we can match the field of
our Enum, and unwrap and access the inside value that we denote as inside_value,
printing it to the console.

Running the code gives us the printout to the terminal as follows:

the following value is an int: 2
the following value is an str: 1

It must be noted that Rust is not going to let anything slip by the compiler. If we remove
the match for our Int field for our Enum, then the compiler will throw the error
seen here:

18 |           match value {
   |           ^^^^^ pattern '&Int(_)' not covered
   |
   = help: ensure that all possible cases are being
     handled,
   possibly by adding wildcards or more match arms
   = note: the matched value is of type '&Value'

This is because we have to handle every single possible outcome. Because we have
been explicit that only values that can be housed in our Enum can be inserted into the
hashmap, we know that there are only two possible types that can be extracted from our
hashmap. We have nearly covered enough about hashmaps to use them effectively in Rust
programs. One last concept that we must cover is the Enum called Option.

Understanding the differences between Python and Rust     17

Considering that we have arrays and vectors, we will not be using our hashmaps primarily
for looping through outcomes. Instead, we will be retrieving values from them when we
need them. Like in Python, the hashmap has a get function. In Python, if the key that
is being searched is not in the dictionary, then the get function will return None. It is
then left to the developer to decide what to do with it. However, in Rust, the hashmap will
return a Some or None. To demonstrate this, let's try to get a value belonging to a key that
we know is not there:

1.  Start by running the following code:

let outcome: Option<&Value> = map.get("test");
println!("outcome passed");
let another_outcome: &Value = \
    map.get("test").unwrap();
println!("another_outcome passed");

Here, we can see that we can access the reference to the Value Enum wrapped
in Option with the get function. We then directly access the reference to the
Value Enum using the unwrap function.

2.  However, we know that the test key is not in the hashmap. Because of this, the

unwrap function will cause the program to crash, as seen in the following output
from the previous code:

thread 'main' panicked at 'called 'Option::unwrap()'
on a 'None' value', src/main.rs:32:51

We can see that the simple get function did not crash the program. However,
we didn't manage to get the string "another_outcome passed" to print out
to the console. We can handle this with a match statement.

However, this is going to be a match statement within a match statement.

3.

In order to reduce the complexity, we should explore Rust functions to process our
value Enum. This can be done with the following code:

fn process_enum(value: &Value) -> () {
    match value {
        Value::Str(inside_value) => {
            println!("the following value is an str: \
              {}", inside_value);
        }
        Value::Int(inside_value) => {

18     An Introduction to Rust from a Python Perspective

            println!("the following value is an int: \
              {}", inside_value);
        }
    }
}

4.

The function does not really give us any new logic to explore. The -> () expression
is merely stating that the function is not returning anything.
If we are going to return a string, for instance, the expression would be ->
String. We do not need the -> () expression; however, it can be helpful
for developers to quickly understand what's going on with the function. We can
then use this function to process the outcome from our get function with the
following code:

match map.get("test") {
    Some(inside_value) => {
        process_enum(inside_value);
    }
    None => {
        println!("there is no value");
    }
}

We now know enough to utilize hashmaps in our programs. However, we must notice that
we have not really handled errors; we have either printed out that nothing was found or let
the unwrap function just result in an error. Considering this, we will move on to the next
section on handling errors in Rust.

Error handling in Rust
Handling errors in Python is straightforward. We have a try block that houses an
except block underneath. In Rust, we have a Result wrapper. This works in the same
way as an Option. However, instead of having Some or None, we have Ok or Err.

To demonstrate this, we can build on the hashmap that was defined in the previous
section. We accept Option from a get function applied to the hashmap. Our function
will check to see whether the integer retrieved from the hashmap is above a threshold. If
it's above the threshold, we will return a true value. If not, then it is false.

Understanding the differences between Python and Rust     19

The problem is that there might not be a value in Option. We also know that the Value
Enum might not be an integer. If any of this is the case, we should return an error. If not,
we return a Boolean. This function can be seen here:

fn check_int_above_threshold(threshold: i32,
    get_result: Option<&Value>) -> Result<bool, &'static \
      str> {
    match get_result {
      Some(inside_value) => {
        match inside_value {
          Value::Str(_) => return Err(
            "str value was supplied as opposed to \
              an int which is needed"),
                Value::Int(int_value) => {
                    if int_value > &threshold {
                        return Ok(true)
                    }
                    return Ok(false)
                }
            }
        }
        None => return Err("no value was supplied to be \
          checked")
    }
}

Here, we can see that the None result from Option instantly returns an error with a
helpful message as to why we are returning an error. With the Some value, we utilize
another match statement to return an error with a helpful message that we cannot
supply a string to check the threshold if the Value is a string. It must be noted that
Value::Str(_) has a _ in it. This means that we do not care what the value is because
we are not going to use it. In the final part, we check to see whether the integer is above
the threshold returning Ok values that are either true or false. We implement this function
with the following code:

let result: Option<&Value> = map.get("two");
let above_threshold: bool = check_int_above_threshold(1, \
    result).unwrap();

20     An Introduction to Rust from a Python Perspective

println!("it is {} that the threshold is breached", \
    above_threshold);

This gives us the following output in the terminal:

it is true that the threshold is breached

If we up the first parameter in our check_int_above_threshold function to 3, we
get the following output:

it is false that the threshold is breached

If we change the key in map.get to three, we get the following terminal output:

thread 'main' panicked at 'called 'Result::unwrap()'
on an 'Err' value: "no value was supplied to be checked"'

If we change the key in map.get to one, we get the following terminal output:

thread 'main' panicked at 'called 'Result::unwrap()' on
an 'Err' value: "str value was supplied as opposed to an
int

We can add extra signposting to the unwrap with the expect function. This function
unwraps the result and adds an extra message to the printout if there is an error. With the
following implementation, the message "an error happened" will be added to the
error message:

let second_result: Option<&Value> = map.get("one");
let second_threshold: bool = check_int_above_threshold(1, \
    second_result).expect("an error happened");

We can also directly throw an error if needed with the following code:

panic!("throwing some error");

We can also check to see whether the result is an error by using the is_err function as
seen here:

result.is_err()

Understanding variable ownership      21

This returns a bool, enabling us to alter the direction of our program if we come
across an error. As we can see, Rust gives us a range of ways in which we can throw
and manage errors.

We can now handle enough of Rust's quirks to write basic scripts. However, if the program
gets a little more complicated, we fall into other pitfalls such as variable ownership and
lifetimes. In the next section, we cover the basics of variable ownership so we can continue
to use our variables throughout a range of functions and structs.

Understanding variable ownership
As we pointed out in the introduction discussing why we should use Rust, Rust doesn't
have a garbage collector; however, it is still memory-safe. We do this to keep the resources
low and the speed high. However, how do we achieve memory safety without a garbage
collector? Rust achieves this by enforcing some strict rules around variable ownership.

Like typing, these rules are enforced when the code is being compiled. Any violation of
these rules will stop the compilation process. This can lead to a lot of initial frustration
for Python developers, as Python developers like to use their variables as and when they
want. If they pass a variable into a function, they also expect that variable to still be able to
be mutated outside the function if they want. This can lead to issues when implementing
concurrent executions. Python also allows this by running expensive processes under the
hood to enable the multiple references with cleanup mechanisms when the variable is no
longer referenced.

As a result, this mismatch in coding style gives Rust the false label of having a steep
learning curve. If we learn the rules, we only must rethink our code a little, as the helpful
compiler enables us to adhere to them easily. You'll also be surprised how this approach is
not as restrictive as it sounds. Rust's compile-time checking is done to protect against the
following memory errors:

•  Use after frees: This is where memory is accessed once it has been freed, which can
cause crashes. It can also allow hackers to execute code via this memory address.

•  Dangling pointers: This is where a reference points to a memory address that no

longer houses the data that the pointer was referencing. Essentially, this pointer now
points to null or random data.

•  Double frees: This is where allocated memory is freed, and then freed again.

This can cause the program to crash and increases the risk of sensitive data being
revealed. This also enables a hacker to execute arbitrary code.

22     An Introduction to Rust from a Python Perspective

•  Segmentation faults: This is where the program tries to access the memory it's not

allowed to access.

•  Buffer overrun: An example of this is reading off the end of an array. This can cause

the program to crash.

Rust manages to protect against these errors by enforcing the following rules:

•  Values are owned by the variables assigned to them.

•  As soon as the variable goes out of scope, it is deallocated from the memory it is

occupying.

•  Values can be used by other variables, if we adhere to the conventions around

copying, moving, immutable borrowing, and mutable borrowing.

To really feel comfortable navigating these rules in code, we will explore copying, moving,
immutable borrowing, and mutable borrowing in more detail.

Copy
This is where the value is copied. Once it has been copied, the new variable owns the
value, and the existing variable also owns its own value:

Figure 1.3 – Variable Copy path

As we can see with the pathway diagram in Figure 1.3, we can continue to use both
variables. If the variable has a Copy trait, the variable will automatically copy the value.
This can be achieved by the following code:

let one: i8 = 10;
let two: i8 = one + 5;
println!("{}", one);
println!("{}", two);

Understanding variable ownership      23

The fact that we can print out both the one and two variables means we know that one
has been copied and the value of this copy has been utilized by two. Copy is the simplest
reference operation; however, if the variable being copied does not have a Copy trait, then
the variable must be moved. To understand this, we will now explore moving as a concept.

Move
This is where the value is moved from one variable to another. However, unlike Copy, the
original variable no longer owns the value:

Figure 1.4 – Variable Move path

Looking at the path diagram in Figure 1.4, we can see that one can no longer be used
as it's been moved to two. We mentioned in the Copy section that if the variable does
not have the Copy trait, then the variable is moved. In the following code, we show
this by doing what we did in the Copy section but using String as this does not have
a Copy trait:

let one: String = String::from("one");
let two: String = one + " two";
println!("{}", two);
println!("{}", one);

Running this gives the following error:

let one: String = String::from("one");
    --- move occurs because 'one' has type
    'String', which does not implement the
    'Copy' trait
let two: String = one + " two";
        ------------ 'one' moved due to usage in operator
println!("{}", two);

24     An Introduction to Rust from a Python Perspective

println!("{}", one);
        ^^^ value borrowed here after move

This is really where the compiler shines. It tells us that the string does not implement the
Copy trait. It then shows us where the move occurs. It is no surprise that many developers
praise the Rust compiler. We can get round this by using the to_owned function with the
following code:

let two: String = one.to_owned() + " two";

It is understandable to wonder why Strings do not have the Copy trait. This is because
the string is a pointer to a string slice. Copying actually means copying bits. Considering
this, if we were to copy strings, we would have multiple unconstrained pointers to the
same string literal data, which would be dangerous. Scope also plays a role when it comes
to moving variables. In order to see how scope forces movement, we need to explore
immutable borrows in the next section.

Immutable borrow
This is where one variable can reference the value of another variable. If the variable that
is borrowing the value falls out of scope, the value is not deallocated from memory as the
variable borrowing the value does not have ownership:

Figure 1.5 – Immutable borrow path

Understanding variable ownership      25

We can see with the path diagram in Figure 1.5 that two borrows the value from one.
When this is happening, one is kind of locked. We can still copy and borrow one;
however, we cannot do a mutable borrow or move while two is still borrowing the value.
This is because if we have mutable and immutable borrows of the same variable, the data
of that variable could change through the mutable borrow causing an inconsistency.
Considering this, we can see that we can have multiple immutable borrows at one time
while only having one mutable borrow at any one time. Once two is finished, we can do
anything we want to one again. To demonstrate this, we can go back to creating our own
print function with the following code:

fn print(input_string: String) -> () {
    println!("{}", input_string);
}

With this, we create a string and pass it through our print function. We then try and
print the string again, as seen in the following code:

let one: String = String::from("one");
print(one);
println!("{}", one);

If we try and run this, we will get an error stating that one was moved into our print
function and therefore cannot be used in println!. We can solve this by merely
accepting a borrow of a string using & in our function, as denoted in the following code:

fn print(input_string: &String) -> () {
    println!("{}", input_string);
}

Now we can pass a borrowed reference into our print function. After this, we can still
access the | variable, as seen in the following code:

let one: String = String::from("one");
print(&one);
let two: String = one + " two";
println!("{}", two);

Borrows are safe and useful. As our programs grow, immutable borrows are safe ways to
pass variables through to other functions in other files. We are nearly at the end of our
journey toward understanding the rules. The only concept left that we must explore is
mutable borrows.

26     An Introduction to Rust from a Python Perspective

Mutable borrow
This is where another variable can reference and write the value of another variable. If
the variable that is borrowing the value falls out of scope, the value is not deallocated
from memory as the variable borrowing the value does not have ownership. Essentially,
a mutable borrow has the same path as an immutable borrow. The only difference is that
while the value is being borrowed, the original variable cannot be used at all. It will be
completely locked down as the value might be altered when being borrowed. The mutable
borrow can be moved into another scope like a function, but cannot be copied as we
cannot have multiple mutable references, as stated in the previous section.

Considering all that we have covered on borrowing, we can see a certain theme. We can
see that scopes play a big role in implementing the rules that we have covered. If the
concept of scopes is unclear, passing a variable into a function is changing scope as a
function is its own scope. To fully appreciate this, we need to move on to exploring scopes
and lifetimes.

Keeping track of scopes and lifetimes
In Python, we do have the concept of scope. It is generally enforced in functions. For
instance, we can call the Python function defined here:

def add_and_square(one: int, two: int) -> int:
    total: int = one + two
    return total * total

In this case, we can access the return variable. However, we will not be able to access
the total variable. Outside of this, most of the variables are accessible throughout the
program. With Rust, it is different. Like typing, Rust is aggressive with scopes. Once a
variable is passed into a scope, it is deleted when the scope is finished. Rust manages to
maintain memory safety without garbage collection with the borrowing rules. Rust deletes
its variables without garbage collection by wiping all variables out of scope. It can also
define scopes with curly brackets. A classic way of demonstrating scopes can be done by
the following code:

fn main() {
    let one: String = String::from("one");

    // start of the inner-scope
    {
        println!("{}", &one);

Keeping track of scopes and lifetimes     27

        let two: String = String::from("two");
    }
    // end of the inner-scope

    println!("{}", one);
    println!("{}", two);
}

If we try and run this code, we get the error code defined here:

println!("{}", two);
        ^^^ not found in this scope

We can see that the variable one can be accessed in the inner-scope as it was defined
outside the outer-scope. However, the variable two is defined in the inner-scope. Once
the inner-scope is finished, we can see by the error that we cannot access the variable two
outside the inner-scope. We must remember that the scope of functions is a little stronger.
From revising borrowing rules, we know that when we move a variable into the scope
of a function, it cannot be accessed outside of the scope of the function if the variable is
not borrowed as it is moved. However, we can still alter a variable inside another scope
like another function, and still then access the changed variable. To do this, we must do
a mutable borrow, and then must dereference (using *) the borrowed mutable variable,
alter the variable, and then access the altered variable outside the function, as we can see
with the following code:

fn alter_number(number: &mut i8) {
    *number += 1
}
fn print_number(number: i8) {
    println!("print function scope: {}", number);
}

fn main() {
    let mut one: i8 = 1;
    print_number(one);
    alter_number(&mut one);
    println!("main scope: {}", one);
}

28     An Introduction to Rust from a Python Perspective

This gives us the following output:

print function scope: 1
main scope: 2

With this, we can see that that if we are comfortable with our borrowing, we can be
flexible and safe with our variables. Now that we have explored the concept of scopes,
this leads naturally to lifetimes, as lifetimes can be defined by scopes. Remember that
a borrow is not sole ownership. Because of this, there is a risk that we could reference
a variable that's deleted. This can be demonstrated in the following classic demonstration
of a lifetime:

fn main() {
    let one;
    {
        let two: i8 = 2;
        one = &two;
    } // -----------------------> two lifetime stops here
    println!("r: {}", one);
}

Running this code gives us the following error:

    one = &two;
     ^^^^ borrowed value does not live long enough
} // -----------------------> two lifetime stops here
- 'two' dropped here while still borrowed
println!("r: {}", one);
                  --- borrow later used here

What has happened here is that we state that there is a variable called one. We then define
an inner-scope. Inside this scope, we define an integer two. We then assign one to be a
reference of two. When we try and print one in the outer-scope, we can't, as the variable
it is pointing to has been deleted. Therefore, we no longer get the issue that the variable is
out of scope, it's that the lifetime of the value that the variable is pointing to is no longer
available, as it's been deleted. The lifetime of two is shorter than the lifetime of one.

Keeping track of scopes and lifetimes     29

While it is great that this is flagged when compiling, Rust does not stop here. This concept
also translates functions. Let's say that we build a function that references two integers,
compares them, and returns the highest integer reference. The function is an isolated
piece of code. In this function, we can denote the lifetimes of the two integers. This is
done by using the ' prefix, which is a lifetime notation. The names of the notations can
be anything you wish, but it's a general convention to use a, b, c, and so on. Let's look at
an example:

fn get_highest<'a>(first_number: &'a i8, second_number: &'\
  a     i8) -> &'a i8 {
    if first_number > second_number {
        return first_number
    } else {
        return second_number
    }
}
fn main() {
    let one: i8 = 1;
    {
        let two: i8 = 2;
        let outcome: &i8 = get_highest(&one, &two);
        println!("{}", outcome);
    }
}

As we can see, the first_number and second_number variables have the same
lifetime notation of a. This means that they have the same lifetimes. We also have to note
that the get_highest function returns an i8 with a lifetime of a. As a result, both
first_number and second_number variables can be returned, which means that
we cannot use the outcome variable outside of the inner-scope. However, we know that
our lifetimes between the variables one and two are different. If we want to utilize the
outcome variable outside of the inner-scope, we must tell the function that there are two
different lifetimes. We can see the definition and implementation here:

fn get_highest<'a, 'b>(first_number: &'a i8, second_ \
  number:   &'b i8) -> &'a i8 {
    if first_number > second_number {
        return first_number
    } else {

30     An Introduction to Rust from a Python Perspective

        return &0
    }
}
fn main() {
    let one: i8 = 1;
    let outcome: &i8;
    {
        let two: i8 = 2;
        outcome = get_highest(&one, &two);
    }
    println!("{}", outcome);
}

Again, the lifetime a is returned. Therefore, the parameter with the lifetime b can be
defined in the inner-scope as we are not returning it in the function. Considering this,
we can see that lifetimes are not exactly essential. We can write comprehensive programs
without touching lifetimes. However, they are an extra tool. We don't have to let scopes
completely constrain us with lifetimes.

We are now at the final stages of knowing enough Rust to be productive Rust developers.
All we need to understand now is building structs and managing them with macros. Once
this is done, we can move onto the next chapter of structuring Rust programs. In the next
section, we will cover the building of structs.

Building structs instead of objects
In Python, we use a lot of objects. In fact, everything you work with in Python is an object.
In Rust, the closest thing we can get to objects is structs. To demonstrate this, let's build
an object in Python, and then replicate the behavior in Rust. For our example, we will
build a basic stock object as seen in the following code:

class Stock:

    def __init__(self, name: str, open_price: float,\
      stop_loss: float = 0.0, take_profit: float = 0.0) \
        -> None:
        self.name: str = name
        self.open_price: float = open_price
        self.stop_loss: float = stop_loss

Building structs instead of objects      31

        self.take_profit: float = take_profit
        self.current_price: float = open_price

    def update_price(self, new_price: float) -> None:
        self.current_price = new_price

Here, we can see that we have two mandatory fields, which are the name and price of the
stock. We can also have an optional stop loss and an optional take profit. This means that
if the stock crosses one of these thresholds, it forces a sale, so we don't continue to lose
more money or keep letting the stock rise to the point where it crashes. We then have a
function that merely updates the current price of the stock. We could add extra logic here
on the thresholds for it to return a bool for whether the stock should be sold or not if
needed. For Rust, we define the fields with the following code:

struct Stock {
    name: String,
    open_price: f32,
    stop_loss: f32,
    take_profit: f32,
    current_price: f32
}

Now we have our fields for the struct, we need to build the constructor. We can build
functions that belong to our struct with an impl block. We build our constructor with
the following code:

impl Stock {

    fn new(stock_name: &str, price: f32) -> Stock {
        return Stock{
            name: String::from(stock_name),
            open_price: price,
            stop_loss: 0.0,
            take_profit: 0.0,
            current_price: price
        }
    }
}

32     An Introduction to Rust from a Python Perspective

Here, we can see that we have defined some default values for some of the attributes. To
build an instance, we use the following code:

let stock: Stock = Stock::new("MonolithAi", 95.0);

However, we have not exactly replicated our Python object. In the Python object __
init__, there were some optional parameters. We can do this by adding the following
functions to our impl block:

    fn with_stop_loss(mut self, value: f32) -> Stock {
        self.stop_loss = value;
        return self
    }
    fn with_take_profit(mut self, value: f32) -> Stock {
        self.take_profit = value;
        return self
    }

What we do here is take in our struct, mutate the field, and then return it. Building a new
stock with a stop loss involves calling our constructor followed by the with_stop_loss
function as seen here:

let stock_two: Stock = Stock::new("RIMES",\
    150.4).with_stop_loss(55.0);

With this, our RIMES stock will have an open price of 150.4, current price of 150.4,
and a stop loss of 55.0. We can chain multiple functions as they return the stock struct.
We can create a stock struct with a stop loss and a take profit with the following code:

let stock_three: Stock = Stock::new("BUMPER (former known \
  as ASF)", 120.0).with_take_profit(100.0).\
    with_stop_loss(50.0);

We can continue chaining with as many optional variables as we want. This also enables
us to encapsulate the logic behind defining these attributes. Now that we have all our
constructor needs sorted, we need to edit the update_price attribute. This can be
done by implementing the following function in the impl block:

fn update_price(&mut self, value: f32) {
    self.current_price = value;
}

Building structs instead of objects      33

This can be implemented with the following code:

let mut stock: Stock = Stock::new("MonolithAi", 95.0);
stock.update_price(128.4);
println!("here is the stock: {}", stock.current_price);

It has to be noted that the stock needs to be mutable. The preceding code gives us the
following printout:

here is the stock: 128.4

There is only one concept left to explore for structs and this is traits. As we have stated
before, traits are like Python mixins. However, traits can also act as a data type because
we know that a struct that has the trait has those functions housed in the trait. To
demonstrate this, we can create a CanTransfer trait in the following code:

trait CanTransfer {
    fn transfer_stock(&self) -> ();

    fn print(&self) -> () {
        println!("a transfer is happening");
    }
}

If we implement the trait for a struct, the instance of the struct can utilize the print
function. However, the transfer_stock function doesn't have a body. This means that
we must define our own function if it has the same return value. We can implement the
trait for our struct using the following code:

impl CanTransfer for Stock {
    fn transfer_stock(&self) -> () {
        println!("the stock {} is being transferred for \
          £{}", self.name, self.current_price);
    }
}

We can now use our trait with the following code:

let stock: Stock = Stock::new("MonolithAi", 95.0);
stock.print();
stock.transfer_stock();

34     An Introduction to Rust from a Python Perspective

This gives us the following output:

a transfer is happening
the stock MonolithAi is being transferred for £95

We can make our own function that will print and transfer the stock. It will accept all
structs that implement our CanTransfer trait and we can use all the trait's functions
in it, as seen here:

fn process_transfer(stock: impl CanTransfer) -> () {
    stock.print();
    stock.transfer_stock();
}

We can see that traits are a powerful alternative to object inheritance; they reduce the
amount of repeated code for structs that fit in the same group. There is no limit to the
number of traits that a struct can implement. This enables us to plug traits in and out,
adding a lot of flexibility to our structs when maintaining code.

Traits are not the only way by which we can manage how structs interact with the rest
of the program; we can achieve metaprogramming with macros, which we will explore
in the next section.

Metaprogramming with macros instead of
decorators
Metaprogramming can generally be described as a way in which the program can
manipulate itself based on certain instructions. Considering the strong typing Rust has,
one of the simplest ways that we can metaprogram is by using generics. A classic example
of demonstrating generics is through coordinates:

struct Coordinate <T> {
        x: T,
        y: T
    }
fn main() {
    let one = Coordinate{x: 50, y: 50};
    let two = Coordinate{x: 500, y: 500};
    let three = Coordinate{x: 5.6, y: 5.6};
}

Metaprogramming with macros instead of decorators     35

What is happening here is that the compiler is looking through all the uses of our struct
throughout the whole program. It then creates structs that have those types. Generics
are a good way of saving time and getting the compiler to write repetitive code. While
this is the simplest form of metaprogramming, another form of metaprogramming in
Rust is macros.

You may have noticed throughout the chapter that some of the functions that we use,
such as the println! function, have an ! at the end. This is because it is not technically
a function, it is a macro. The ! denotes that the macro is being called. Defining our own
macros is a blend of defining our own function and using lifetime notation within a
match statement within the function. To demonstrate this, we can define our own macro
that capitalizes the first character in a string passed through it with the following code:

macro_rules! capitalize {
        ($a: expr) => {
            let mut v: Vec<char> = $a.chars().collect();
            v[0] = v[0].to_uppercase().nth(0).unwrap();
            $a = v.into_iter().collect();
        }
    }
fn main() {
    let mut x = String::from("test");
    capitalize!(x);
    println!("{}", x);
}

Instead of using the fn term that is used for defining functions, we define our macro
using macro_rules!. We then say that the $a is the expression passed into the macro.
We then get the expression, convert it into a vector of chars, uppercase the first character,
and then convert it back to a string. It must be noted that the macro that we defined does
not return anything, and we do not assign any variable when calling our macro in the
main function. However, when we print the x variable at the end of the main function, it
is capitalized. Therefore, we can deduce that our macro is altering the state of the variable.

However, we must remember that macros are a last resort. Our example shows that our
macro alters the state even though it is not directly demonstrated in the main function.
As the complexity of the program grows, we could end up with a lot of brittle, highly
coupled processes that we are not aware of. If we change one thing, it could break five
other things. For capitalizing the first letter, it is better to just build a function that does
this and returns a string value.

36     An Introduction to Rust from a Python Perspective

Macros do not just stop at what we have covered, they also have the same effect as our
decorators in Python. To demonstrate this, let's look at our coordinate again. We can
generate our coordinate and then pass it through a function so it can be moved. We then
try to print the coordinate outside of the function with the following code:

struct Coordinate {
    x: i8,
    y: i8
}
fn print(point: Coordinate) {
    println!("{} {}", point.x, point.y);
}
fn main() {
    let test = Coordinate{x: 1, y:2};
    print(test);
    println!("{}", test.x)
}

It will be expected that Rust will refuse to compile the code because the coordinate has
been moved into the scope of the print function that we created and therefore we
cannot use it in the final println!. We could borrow the coordinate and pass that
through to the function. However, there is another way we can do this. Remember that
integers passed through functions without any trouble because they had a Copy trait.
Now, we could try and code a Copy trait ourselves, but this would be convoluted and
would require advanced knowledge. Luckily for us, we can implement the Copy and
Clone traits by utilizing a derive macro with the following code:

#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
struct Coordinate {
        x: i8,
        y: i8
    }

With this, our code works as we copy the coordinate when passing it through the
function. Macros can be utilized by many packages and frameworks, from JavaScript
Object Notation (JSON) serialization to entire web frameworks. In fact, here is the classic
example of running a basic server in the Rocket framework:

Summary     37

#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)]

#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;

#[get("/hello/<name>/<age>")]
fn hello(name: String, age: u8) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {} year old named {}!", age, name)
}
fn main() {
    rocket::ignite().mount("/", routes![hello]).launch();
}

This is a striking resemblance to the Python Flask application example at the beginning
of the chapter. These macros are acting exactly like our decorators in Python, which is not
surprising as a decorator in Python is a form of metaprogramming that wraps a function.

This wraps up our brief introduction to the Rust language for Python developers. We are
now able to move on to other concepts, such as structuring our code and building fully
fledged programs coded in Rust.

Summary
In this chapter, we explored the role of Rust in today's landscape, showing that Rust's
paradigm-changing position is a result of being memory-safe, while not having any
garbage collection. With this, we understood why it beats most languages (including
Golang) when it comes to speed. We then went over the quirks that Rust has when it
comes to strings, lifetimes, memory management, and typing, so we can write safe and
efficient Rust code as Python developers. We then covered structs and traits to the point
where we could mimic the basic functionality of a Python object with mixins, utilizing
their traits as types for the Rust struct while we were at it.

38     An Introduction to Rust from a Python Perspective

We covered the basic concepts of lifetimes and borrowing. This enables us to have more
control over how we implement our structs and functions within our program, giving
us multiple avenues to turn to when solving a problem. With all this, we can safely code
single-page applications with confidence over concepts that would stump someone who
has never coded in Rust. However, we know, as experienced Python developers, that any
serious program worth coding spans multiple pages. Considering this, we can use what we
have learned here to move on to the next chapter, where we set up a Rust environment on
our own computers and learn how to structure Rust code over multiple files, enabling us
to get one step closer to building packages in Rust and installing them with pip.

Questions

1.  Why can we not simply copy a String?

2.  Rust has strong typing. In which two ways can we enable a container such as

a vector or hashmap to contain multiple different types?

3.  How are Python decorators and Rust macros the same?
4.  What is the Python equivalent to a main function in Rust?

5.  Why can we get a higher integer value with the same number of bytes with an

unsigned integer than a signed integer?

6.  Why do we have to be strict with lifetimes and scopes when coding in Rust?

7.  Can we reference a variable when it has been moved?

8.  What can you do to an original variable if it is currently being borrowed in an

immutable state?

9.  What can you do to an original variable if it is currently being borrowed in a

mutable state?

Answers

1.  This is because a String is essentially a pointer to Vec<u8> with some metadata. If
we copy this, then we will have multiple unconstrained pointers to the same string
literal, which will introduce errors with concurrency, mutability, and lifetimes.

2.  We can use an Enum, which means that the type being accepted into the container
can be one of those types housed in the Enum. When reading the data, we can
then use a match statement to manage all possible data types that could be read
from the container. The second way is to create a trait that multiple different structs
implement. However, the only interaction that we can have from the container read
when this is the case is the functions that the trait implements.

Further reading     39

3.  They both wrap around the code and alter the implementation or attributes of the

code that they are wrapping without directly returning anything.
4.  The Python equivalent is if __name__ == "__main__":.

5.  A signed integer must accommodate positive and negative values, whereas an

unsigned integer only accommodates positive values.

6.  This is because there is no garbage collection; as a result, variables get deleted

when they shift out of the scope of where they were created. If we do not consider
lifetimes, we could reference a variable that has been deleted.

7.  No, the ownership of the variable has essentially been moved and there are no

references to the original variable anymore.

8.  We can still copy and borrow the original variable; however, we cannot perform

a mutable borrow.

9.  We cannot use the original variable at all as the state of the variable might

be altered.

Structuring
Code in Rust

Now that we have gotten to grips with the basics of Rust, we can move on to structuring
code over several files so we can actually solve problems with Rust. In order to do this, we
will have to understand how to manage dependencies as well as how to compile a basic
and structured application. We also have to consider the isolation of code so we can reuse
it and keep the development of the application agile, enabling us to make changes quickly
without much pain. After covering this, we will also get the application to interact with
the user directly by accepting user commands. We will also utilize Rust crates. A crate
is a binary or library that we import and use.

In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

•  Managing our code with crates and Cargo instead of pip

•  Structuring code over multiple files and modules

•  Building module interfaces

•  Interacting with the environment

42     Structuring Code in Rust

Technical requirements
We are no longer going to be implementing simple single-page applications that do not
rely on any third-party dependencies as we did in the first chapter. As a result, you will
have to directly install Rust onto your computer. We will also be managing third-party
dependencies through Cargo. You can install Rust and Cargo on your computer here:
https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.

At the time of writing this, the best integrated development environment (IDE) by far
for writing Rust is Visual Studio Code. It has a range of Rust plugins that can help you
keep track of and check your Rust code. It can be installed using this link: https://
code.visualstudio.com/download.

You can find all the code files in the GitHub repository for this chapter: https://
github.com/PacktPublishing/Speed-up-your-Python-with-Rust/
tree/main/chapter_two.

Managing our code with crates and Cargo
instead of pip
Building our own application is going to involve the following steps:

1.  Create a simple Rust file and run it.

2.  Create a simple application using Cargo.

3.  Run our application using Cargo.

4.  Manage dependencies with Cargo.

5.  Use a third-party crate to serialize JSON.

6.  Document our application with Cargo.

Before we start structuring our program with Cargo, we should compile a basic Rust script
and run it:

1.  To do this, make a file called hello_world.rs with the main function housing

the println! function with a string, as we can see here:

fn main() {
    println!("hello world");
}

Managing our code with crates and Cargo instead of pip     43

2.  Once this is done, we can navigate to the file and run the rustc command:

rustc hello_world.rs

3.  This command compiles the file into a binary to be run. If we compile on Windows,

we can run the binary with the following command:

.\hello_world.exe

4.

If we compile it on Linux or Mac, we can run it with the following command:

./hello_world

The console should then print out the string. While this can come in useful
when building a standalone file, it is not recommended for managing programs
spanning multiple files. It is not even recommended when relying on dependencies.
This is where Cargo comes in. Cargo manages everything – the running, testing,
documentation, building, and dependency out of the box – with a few simple
commands.

Now that we have a basic understanding of how to compile a basic file, we can move on
to building a fully fledged application:

1.

In your terminal, navigate to where you want your application to sit, and create
a new project called wealth_manager as follows:

cargo new wealth_manager

This will create our application with the following structure:

└── wealth_manage
     ├── .git
    ├── Cargo.toml
    ├── .gitignore
    └── src
        └── main.rs

Here, we can see that Cargo has built the basic structure of an application that
can manage compilations, work with GitHub, and manage dependencies right out
of the box. The metadata and dependencies of our application are defined in the
Cargo.toml file.

44     Structuring Code in Rust

In order to perform Cargo commands on this application, our terminal is going
to have to be in the same directory as the Cargo.toml file. The code that we are
going to be altering that makes up our application is housed in the src directory.
Our entry point for the whole application is in the main.rs file. In Python, we
can have multiple entry points, and we will explore these in Chapter 4, Building pip
Modules in Python, where we will build pure Python packages for the first time. If
we open the .gitignore file, we should have the following:

/target

This is not a mistake; this is how clean Rust is. Everything that Cargo produces
when it comes to compiling, documenting, caching, and so on is all stored in the
target directory.

2.  Right now, all we have is the main file that has a printout to the console saying

"hello world." We can run this with the following command:

cargo run

3.  With this command, we get the following output in the terminal:

Compiling wealth_manager v0.1.0 (/Users/maxwellflitton
/Documents/github/book_two/chapter_two/wealth_manager)

Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.45s

Running 'target/debug/wealth_manager'

Hello, world!

Here, we can see that the application is being compiled. Once it's been compiled, it
states that the compilation process has finished.

However, we have to note that it states that the finished process is unoptimized
with debug info. This means that the compiled product is not as fast as it could
be; however, it does contain debugging info if needed. This type of compilation
is fast compared to an optimized version and is to be used when developing an
application, as opposed to live production environments. We then see that the
binary file that has been compiled is in target/debug/wealth_manager,
and this is then run, resulting in the hello_world.rs output.

Managing our code with crates and Cargo instead of pip     45

4.

If we want to run a release, we simply run the following command:

cargo run --release

This compiles an optimized version of our app in the ./target/release/
directory under the binary wealth_manager. If we just want to compile our
application without running it, we can simply swap the run command for build.

Now that we have got our application running, let's explore how we manage the metadata
around it. This can all be done by editing the Cargo.toml file. When we open this, we
get the following:

[package]
name = "wealth_manager"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["maxwellflitton"]
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]

The name, version, and authors are fairly straightforward. Here are the effects each section
has on the project:

•  If we change the name value in the Cargo.toml file, then new binaries with that
name will be made when we build or run our application. The old ones will still be
there too.

•  version is for distribution on services such as crates.io if we want to open
source our application for others to use. The authors are required for this as well,
and our application will still compile and run locally if it's not there.

•  edition is the edition of Rust that we are using. Rust gets updated frequently.
These updates accumulate through time, and every two to three years, the

edition-support/.

•  We also have dependencies. This is where we can import third-party crates.

46     Structuring Code in Rust

To see how this works, let's use a crate to convert a data structure of stock into JSON and
then print it. Writing the code ourselves would be a bit of a headache. Luckily, we can
install the serde crate and use the json! macro. In order for Cargo to download and
install the crate, we fill our dependencies section in our Cargo.toml file with the code
given here:

[dependencies]
serde="1.0.117"
serde_json="1.0.59"

In our main.rs file, we then import the macro and struct needed to convert data about
a stock into JSON and then print it out in the following code:

use serde_json::{json, Value};

fn main() {
    let stock: Value = json!({
        "name": "MonolithAi",
        "price": 43.7,
        "history": [19.4, 26.9, 32.5]
    });

    println!("first price: {}", stock["history"][0]);
    println!("{}", stock.to_string());
}

It is important to note that we are returning a Value struct from the serde_json
value. In order to see how we can use the return value, we can explore the documentation
of the struct. This is when we get to see that Rust's documentation system is very
comprehensive. We can find the documentation of the struct here: https://docs.rs/
serde_json/1.0.64/serde_json/enum.Value.html.

We can see in Figure 2.1 that the documentation covers all of the functions that the
struct supports. Our json! macro is returning Object(Map<String, Value>).
We also have a range of other values, depending on how we call the json! macro. The
documentation also covers a range of functions that we can exploit to check what type the
value is, whether the JSON value is null, and ways in which we can cast the JSON value
as a particular type:

Figure 2.1 – Documentation of the serde_json value

When we perform a Cargo run command, we will see Cargo compiling the crates that
we defined in the dependencies. We then see the compilation of our own app, and the
printout of the price and the data related to the stock, as shown here:

first price: 19.4
{"history":[19.4,26.9,32.5], "name":"MonolithAi",\
  "price":43.7}

48     Structuring Code in Rust

Going back to the documentation, we can create our own. This is straightforward; we do
not have to install anything. All we have to do is create documentation in the code, like
docstrings in Python. In order to demonstrate this, we can create a function that adds two
variables together and defines the docstring, as seen in the following code:

/// Adds two numbers together.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * one (i32): one of the numbers to be added
/// * two (i32): one of the numbers to be added
///
/// # Returns
/// (i32): the sum of param one and param two
///
/// # Usage
/// The function can be used by the following code:
///
/// '''rust
/// result: i32 = add_numbers(2, 5);
/// '''
fn add_numbers(one: i32, two: i32) -> i32 {
    return one + two
}

We can see that this documentation is Markdown! This example is overkill for this type
of function. A standard developer should be able to implement this function without
any examples. For more complex functions and structs, it is worth noting that there is
nothing stopping us from documenting code examples on how to implement what we are
documenting. Building the documentation only requires the command here:

cargo doc

After the process has finished, we can open the documentation with the following
command:

cargo doc --open

Managing our code with crates and Cargo instead of pip     49

This opens up the documentation in a web browser, as shown in Figure 2.2:

Figure 2.2 – Documentation view of our module

What we can see here is that our main and add_numbers functions are available. We
can also see on the left that the dependencies that were installed are also available. If we
click on our add_numbers function, we get to see the Markdown that we wrote, as
shown in Figure 2.3:

Figure 2.3 – Documentation view of our add_numbers function

50     Structuring Code in Rust

Here we have it – we can create interactive documentation of our code as we build our
application. It has to be noted that the rest of the book will not have Markdown in the
code snippets; otherwise, this would simply extend the book to an unnecessary length.
However, it is good practice to document all structs and functions as you code.

Now that we have run our code, set up a basic application structure, and documented
our code, we are ready to move on to the next section of structuring our application over
multiple files.

Structuring code over multiple files and
modules
In order to build our module, we are going to carry out the following steps:

1.  Map out our file and folder structure.
2.  Create our Stock structs.
3.  Link our Stock struct to the main file.
4.  Use our stocks module in the main file.

5.  Add code from another module.

Now that we are at the stage of building out our application over multiple files, we have to
define our first module in our application, which is the stocks module:

1.  We can make our module have the structure defined as follows:

├── main.rs
└── stocks
    ├── mod.rs
    └── structs
        ├── mod.rs
        └── stock.rs

We have taken this structure to enable flexibility; if we need to add more structs, we
can do so in the structs directory. We can also add other directories alongside
the structs directory. For instance, we might want to build a mechanism
for storing the data for our stocks. This can be achieved by adding a storage
directory in the stocks directory and using this throughout the module as and
when it is needed.

Structuring code over multiple files and modules       51

2.  For now, we simply want to create a stock struct in our stocks module, import it

into our main.rs file, and use it. Our first step is to define our Stock struct in our
stock.rs file with this code:

pub struct Stock {
    pub name: String,
    pub open_price: f32,
    pub stop_loss: f32,
    pub take_profit: f32,
    pub current_price: f32
}

This looks familiar, as it is the same as the Stock struct that we defined in the
previous chapter. However, there is a slight difference. We must note that there is a
pub keyword before the struct definition and each field definition. This is because
we have to declare them public before we can use them outside the file. This also
applies to functions implemented in the same file, as shown in the following code:

impl Stock {
    pub fn new(stock_name: &str, price: f32) -> \
      Stock {
        return Stock{
            name: String::from(stock_name),
            open_price: price,
            stop_loss: 0.0,
            take_profit: 0.0,
            current_price: price
        }
    }
    pub fn with_stop_loss(mut self, value: f32) \
      -> Stock {
        self.stop_loss = value;
        return self
    }
    pub fn with_take_profit(mut self, value: f32) \
      -> Stock {
        self.take_profit = value;
        return self
    }

52     Structuring Code in Rust

    pub fn update_price(&mut self, value: f32) {
        self.current_price = value;
    }
}

We can see that we now have a public struct that is available with all its functions.
We now have to enable our struct to be used in the main.rs file. This is where the mod.
rs files come in. mod.rs files are essentially __init__.py files in Python. They show
that the directory is a module. However, unlike Python, Rust data structures need to be
publicly declared in order to be accessed from other files. We can see how the struct is
passed through our stocks module to our main.rs file in Figure 2.4:

Figure 2.4 – How a struct is passed through modules

Here, we can see that we are merely publicly declaring the struct in the module furthest
away from main.rs in the mod.rs file belonging to that directory. We then publicly
declare the structs module in the stocks mod.rs file. Here is a good time to explore
the mod expression that declares modules. If we want to, we can declare multiple modules
in a single file. It must be stressed that this is not happening in our example. We could
declare module one and module two in a single file with the following code:

mod one {
    . . .
}
Mod two {
    . . .
}

Structuring code over multiple files and modules       53

Now that we have defined our modules in our main example project, we just declare the
stocks module in the main.rs file. The reason why this is not a public declaration is
that the main.rs file is the entry point of our application; we will not be importing this
module into anything else:

1.  Now that our struct is available, we can simply use it as we would if it was defined in

the same file with the following:

mod stocks;
use stocks::structs::stock::Stock;

fn main() {
    let stock: Stock = Stock::new("MonolithAi", 36.5);
    println!("here is the stock name: {}",\
      stock.name);
    println!("here is the stock name: {}",\
      stock.current_price);
}

2.  Running this code unsurprisingly gives us this:

here is the stock name: MonolithAi
here is the stock name: 36.5

Now that we have the basics of using structs from different files covered, we can move on
to exploring other pathways of accessing data structures from other files in order to be
more flexible:

1.  The first concept we have to explore is accessing from files in the same directory.
In order to demonstrate this, we can do a throwaway example of building a print
function in the structs. In a new file with the src/stocks/structs/utils.rs
path, we can create a toy function that merely prints out that the constructor for the
struct is firing, as shown in the following code:

pub fn constructor_shout(stock_name: &str) -> () {
    println!("the constructor for the {} is firing", \
      stock_name);
}

54     Structuring Code in Rust

2.  We then declare it in our src/stocks/structs/mod.rs file with the following

code:

pub mod stock;
mod utils;

It must be noted that we are not making it public; we just declare it instead. Nothing
is stopping us from making it public; however, with the non-public approach, we
only allow files within the directory of src/stocks/structs/ to access it.
3.  We now want our Stock struct to access it and use it in our constructor, which
can be done with an import in src/stocks/structs/stock.rs with the
following line:

use super::utils::constructor_shout;

4.

If we want to move our reference to the src/stocks/ directory, we can use
super::super. We can chain as many supers as we want, depending on how deep
the tree is. It has to be noted that we can only access what is declared in the mod.rs
file of the directory. In our src/stocks/structs/stock.rs file, we can now
use the function in our constructor with the following code:

pub fn new(stock_name: &str, price: f32) -> Stock {
    constructor_shout(stock_name);
    return Stock{
        name: String::from(stock_name),
        open_price: price,
        stop_loss: 0.0,
        take_profit: 0.0,
        current_price: price
    }
}

5.  Now, if we run our application, we will get the following printout in the terminal:

the constructor for the MonolithAi is firing
here is the stock name: MonolithAi
here is the stock name: 36.5

Building module interfaces       55

We can see that the program runs in exactly the same way, with the additional line
from the util function that we imported from. If we create another module, we
can access our stocks module from it, because the stocks module is defined in
the main.rs file.

While we have managed to access data structures from different files and modules, this is
not very scalable, and there are going to be some rules in which we implement stocks. In
order to enable us to write scalable safe code, we need to lock down the functionality with
interfaces in the next section.

Building module interfaces
Unlike Python, where we can import anything we want from anywhere and at the
most our IDE will just give us a syntax highlight, Rust will actively not compile if we
try and access data structures that have not explicitly been made public. This gives us
an opportunity to really lock down our modules and enforce functionality through an
interface.

However, before we get started with this, let's fully explore what functionality we will be
locking down. It is good practice to keep modules as isolated as possible. In our stocks
module, the logic should only be around how to handle stocks and nothing else. This
might seem a little overkill, but when we think about it, we quickly realize that this
module is going to scale when it comes to complexity.

For the demonstrative purposes of this chapter, let's just build the functionality for a stock
order. We can either buy or sell a stock. These stock orders come in multiples. It's fairly
common to buy n stocks of a company. We will also have to check to see whether the stock
order is short or long. With a short order, we borrow money from the broker, buy stocks
with that money, sell them instantly, and then buy the stocks back at a later date. If the
stock price goes down, we make money, as we keep the difference when repaying to the
broker. If we go long, we just buy the stock and hold it. If it goes up, we make money, so
depending on the order, there will be different outcomes.

56     Structuring Code in Rust

We have to remember that this is not a book for developing software around stock
markets, so we need to keep the details simple to avoid losing ourselves. A simple
approach for us to take to demonstrate interfaces is to take a layered approach, as
described in Figure 2.5:

Figure 2.5 – Approach to a simple module interface

In order to achieve this approach, we can carry out the following steps:

1.  Structure the module layout with the right files.

2.  Create an enum for the different types of orders.

3.  Build an order struct.

Install the chrono crate needed for datetime objects.
4.
5.  Create an order constructor that utilizes the chrono crate.

6.  Create dynamic values for the struct.

7.  Create a close order interface.

8.  Create an open order interface.

9.  Use the order interfaces in the main file.

Building module interfaces       57

Let's get started:

1.  Here, we only allow ourselves to access the stock struct through the order struct.

Again, there are other ways to approach this problem, which is a demonstration of
how to build interfaces in Rust. In order to achieve this in the code, we have the file
structure defined as follows:

├── main.rs
└── stocks
    ├── enums
    │   ├── mod.rs
    │   └── order_types.rs
    ├── mod.rs
    └── structs
        ├── mod.rs
        ├── order.rs
        └── stock.rs

2.  First of all, we can define our enum order types in our enums/order_types.rs

file with the following code:

pub enum OrderType {
    Short,
    Long
}

3.  We will use this in our order and interfaces. In order to make this enum type

available to the rest of the module, we have to declare it in our enums/mod.rs file
with the following code:

pub mod order_types;

4.  Now that we have built our enum type, it is time to put it to work. We can now
build our order struct in our stocks/structs/order.rs file with the
following code:

use chrono::{Local, DateTime};
use super::stock::Stock;
use super::super::enums::order_types::OrderType;

pub struct Order {

58     Structuring Code in Rust

    pub date: DateTime<Local>,
    pub stock: Stock,
    pub number: i32,
    pub order_type: OrderType
}

5.  Here, we use the chrono crate to define when the order was placed; we also have
to note what stock the order is for, the number of stocks that we are buying, and
the type of order. We have to remember to define our chrono dependency on our
Cargo.toml file with the following code:

[dependencies]
serde="1.0.117"
serde_json="1.0.59"
chrono="0.4.19"

The reason why we have kept our stock struct separate from the order struct is to
allow flexibility. For instance, there are other things that we can do with stock data
that is not an order. We may want to build a struct that houses stocks on the user
watch list and the user hasn't actually bought anything, but they still want to see the
stocks available.

6.  There are other use cases for stock data, however. Considering this, we can see that
keeping the data and methods around a stock in an individual stock struct helps
to not only reduce the amount of code we have to write if we add more features
but also standardizes the data around a stock. This also makes it easier for us to
maintain the code. If we add or delete a field, or change a method for stock data, we
only have to change it in one place as opposed to multiple places. Our constructor
for our order struct can be made in the same file with the following code:

impl Order {
    pub fn new(stock: Stock, number: i32, \
      order_type: OrderType) -> Order {
      let today: DateTime<Local> = Local::now();
        return Order{date: today, stock, number, \
          order_type}
    }
}

Here we create an Order struct by accepting stock, number, and order_type
arguments and creating a datetime struct.

Building module interfaces       59

7.  Because our order focuses on the logic around pricing the order as it houses the

number of stocks brought in an order, in our impl block, we can build our current
value of the order with the following code:

    pub fn current_value(&self) -> f32 {
        return self.stock.current_price * self \
          .number as f32
    }

It has to be noted that we have used &self as a parameter instead of just using
self. This enables us to use the function multiple times. If the parameter was not
a reference, then we would move the struct into the function. We would not be able
to calculate the value multiple times, and it's going to be useful to do so unless the
type is Copy.

8.  We can also build on this function to calculate the current profit in the impl block

with the following code:

    pub fn current_profit(&self) -> f32 {
        let current_price: f32 = self.current_value();
        let initial_price: f32 = self.stock. \
          open_price * self.number as f32;

        match self.order_type {
          OrderType::Long => return current_price -\
            initial_price,
          OrderType::Short => return initial_price -\
            current_price
        }
    }

Here, we get the current price and the initial price. We then match the order type,
as this will change how the profit is calculated. Now our structs are complete, we
have to ensure that the structs are available by defining them in the stocks/
structs/mod.rs file with the following code:

pub mod stock;
pub mod order;

60     Structuring Code in Rust

9.  We are now ready to create our interfaces. In order to build our interface in our
stocks /mod.rs file, we initially have to import everything that we need, as
shown in the following code:

pub mod structs;
pub mod enums;

use structs::stock::Stock;
use structs::order::Order;
use enums::order_types::OrderType;

10.  Now that we have everything to build our interface, we can build our close order

interface with the following code:

pub fn close_order(order: Order) -> f32 {
    println!("order for {} is being closed", \
      &order.stock.name);
    return order.current_profit()
}

11.  This is a fairly simple interface; we could do more, such as a database or API call,
but for this demonstration, we merely print that the stock is being sold and return
the current profit that we have made. With this in mind, we can build our more
complex interface by opening an order in the same file with the following code:

pub fn open_order(number: i32, order_type: OrderType,\
                  stock_name: &str, open_price: f32,\
                  stop_loss: Option<f32>, \
                    take_profit: Option<f32>) -> \
                      Order { \
    println!("order for {} is being made", \
      &stock_name);
    let mut stock: Stock = Stock::new(stock_name, \
      open_price);
    match stop_loss {
        Some(value) => stock = \
          stock.with_stop_loss(value),
        None => {}
    }

Building module interfaces       61

    match take_profit {
        Some(value) => stock = \
          stock.with_take_profit(value),
        None => {}
    }
    return Order::new(stock, number, order_type)
}

Here, we take in all of the parameters that we need. We have also introduced the
Option<f32> argument type, which is implemented as an enum type. This allows
us to pass in a None value. We then create a mutable stock (as the price will vary
and we will have to update it), and then check to see whether the stop_loss value
is provided; if it is, we then add the stop loss to the stock. We then check to see
whether the take_profit value is provided, updating the stock with this if it is.

12.  Now that we have built all our interfaces, all we need to do is to use them in the

main.rs file. In the main file, we need to import the needed structs and interfaces
to utilize them with the following code:

mod stocks;

use stocks::{open_order, close_order};
use stocks::structs::order::Order;
use stocks::enums::order_types::OrderType;

13.  In our main function, we can start putting these interfaces to work by creating

a new mutable order with the following code:

println!("hello stocks");
let mut new_order: Order = open_order(20, \
    OrderType::Long, "bumper", 56.8, None, None);

14.  Here, we have set take_profit and stop_loss to None, but we can add them

if we need to. To clarify what we have just bought, we can print out the current value
and profit with the following code:

println!("the current price is: {}",
    &new_order.current_value());
println!("the current profit is: {}",
    &new_order.current_profit());

62     Structuring Code in Rust

15.  We then get some movement in the stock market, which we can simulate by

updating the price and printing the value of our investment at each change with the
following code:

new_order.stock.update_price(43.1);
println!("the current price is: {}", \
    &new_order.current_value());
println!("the current profit is: {}", \
    &new_order.current_profit());

new_order.stock.update_price(82.7);
println!("the current price is: {}", \
         &new_order.current_value());
println!("the current profit is: {}", \
         &new_order.current_profit());

16.  We now have a profit, and we will sell our stock to close the order and print out the

profit with the following code:

let profit: f32 = close_order(new_order);
println!("we made {} profit", profit);

17.  Now, our interfaces, module, and main file are built. Running the Cargo run

command gives us the following printout:

hello stocks
the constructor for the bumper is firing
the current price is: 1136
the current profit is: 0
the current price is: 862
the current profit is: -274
the current price is: 1654
the current profit is: 518
order for bumper is being closed
we made 518 profit

Building module interfaces       63

As we can see, our module works and it has a clean interface. For this book, our example
stops here, as we have shown how we can build modules in Rust with interfaces. However,
if you want to go further with building out the application, we can take the approach seen
in Figure 2.6:

Figure 2.6 – Building out our application

In the account module, we would build data structures around keeping track of the
amount the user has through trades. We would then build a storage module that has read
and write interfaces for accounts and stocks. The reason why storage is a separate module
is that we can keep the interfaces the same, and chop and change the storage logic under
the hood.

For instance, we could start with a simple JSON file storage system for development and
local usage; however, the application then gets put onto a server, and loads of users start
making trades and accessing their accounts. We can switch the file reading and write for
a database driver with database model mapping. The system then gets a lot of traffic and
the application gets split into a cluster of microservices. One application would still be
talking to a database, while another one for frequently requested stocks/accounts could be
talking to a Redis cache.

Considering this, keeping the storage separate keeps us flexible. Changing the
requirements for the storage is not going to break the build. In fact, a configuration file
could enable the switching of different methods, depending on the environment. As long
as the interfaces remain the same, refactoring will not be a huge task.

64     Structuring Code in Rust

Benefits of documentation when coding
As our module spans multiple files, we are now referencing functions and structs that
are in different files. This is where the importance of documentation can be seen. We can
revisit our point in the technical requirements of using Visual Studio Code. The code in
GitHub is fully documented. If the Rust plugins are installed, merely hovering the mouse
over the struct or function will pop up the documentation, allowing us to see what is
needed in our interface, as shown in Figure 2.7:

Figure 2.7 – Popup documentation in Visual Studio Code

There is a reason why badly structured code that isn't documented is referred to as tech
debt, and this is because it collects interest over time. Poorly structured code with no
documentation is quick to develop, however, and as the size of the application grows, it's
going to get harder to change things and understand what is going on. A well-structured
module with good Markdown Rust documentation is a great way to keep you and your
team's productivity high.

We now have a functioning application that spans multiple pages and is clean and scalable.
However, a user cannot dynamically use it, as everything has to be hardcoded. This is not
practical. In the next section, we interact with the environment so we can pass arguments
into the program.

Interacting with the environment     65

Interacting with the environment
We are at the stage in which the only thing that is holding us back from building a fully
functioning command-line application is interacting with the environment. As stated
in the previous section, this is an open-ended subject that spans anything from taking
command-line arguments to interacting with servers and databases. As in the previous
section, we will cover enough in order to get an understanding of how to structure Rust
code that accepts data from the outside and processes it.

In order to explore this, we are going to get our stock application to take in
command-line arguments from the user so that we can either buy or sell a stock.
We will not over-complicate things by choosing whether to go short or go long, and
we will not introduce storage.

However, by the end of this section, we will be equipped to approach building code that
scales and accepts data from the outside world. With this, further reading on crates that
connect to databases or read/write files will enable us to seamlessly add them to our
well-structured code. In terms of databases, we will cover how to mirror the schema of a
database and connect to it in Chapter 10, Injecting Rust into a Python Flask App.

For our toy example, we will be generating a random number for our sale stock price in
order to calculate whether we sell at a profit or loss. We will do this by adding the rand
crate to our dependencies section in the Cargo.toml file with rand="0.8.3". We can
interact with our environment by carrying out the following steps:

1.

Import all the required crates.

2.  Collect the inputs from the environment.

3.  Process our inputs with orders.

Let's get started:

1.  Now that our rand crate has been added, we can add all the extra imports that we

need in the main.rs file with the following code:

use std::env;
use rand::prelude::*;
use std::str::FromStr;

We are using env to get the arguments passed into Cargo. We import everything
from the prelude of the rand crate so that we can generate random numbers,
and we import FromStr trait so that we can convert strings passed in from the
command-line arguments into numbers.

66     Structuring Code in Rust

2.

In our main function, we initially collect the arguments passed in from the
command line with the following code:

let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
let action: &String = &args[1];
let name: &String = &args[2];
let amount: i32 = i32::from_str(&args[3]).unwrap();
let price: f32 = f32::from_str(&args[4]).unwrap();

We state that we are going to collect the command-line arguments in a vector of
strings. We do this because pretty much everything can be represented as a string.
We then define all the parameters that we need. We have to note that we start at
index 1 instead of 0. This is because index 0 is populated with the run command.
We can also see that we are converting the strings into numbers when we need them
and directly unwrapping them. This is a little dangerous; we should ideally match
the result of the from_str function and give better information to the user if we
were building a proper production command-line tool.

3.  Now that we have everything we need, we create a new order with the data we

collected using the following code:

let mut new_order: Order = open_order(amount, \
    OrderType::Long, &name.as_str(), price, \
        None, None);

We are creating a new order every time even if it is a sell because we do not have
storage, and we need to have all the structured data and logic around our stock
position. We then match our actions. If we are going to sell our stock, we generate
a new price for the stock before selling. Considering this, we can see whether we
make a profit or not with the following code:

match action.as_str() {
    "buy" => {
        println!("the value of your investment is:\
          {}", new_order.current_value());
    }
    "sell" => {
        let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();

        let new_price_ref: f32 = rng.gen();
        let new_price: f32 = new_price_ref * 100 as \

Interacting with the environment     67

          f32;

        new_order.stock.update_price(new_price);
        let sale_profit: f32 = close_order(new_order);

        println!("here is the profit you made: {}", \
            sale_profit);
    }
    _ => {
        panic!("Only 'buy' and 'sell' actions are \
          supported");
    }
}

It must be noted that we have a _ at the end of the match expression. This is because
the string could theoretically be anything and Rust is a safe language. It will not
allow us to compile the code if we did not account for every outcome. The _ is a
catch-all pattern. If not all of the match patterns are made, then this is executed. For
us, we merely raise an error, stating that only sell and buy are supported.

4.

In order to run this program, we perform the following command:

cargo run sell monolithai 26 23.4

5.  Running this will give us the following outcome:

order for monolithai is being made
order for monolithai is being closed
here is the profit you made: 1825.456

The profit you make will be different, as the number generated will be random.

Here we have it – our application is interactive and scalable. If you want to build more
comprehensive command-line interfaces with help menus, it is recommended that you
read and utilize the clap crate.

Summary
In this chapter, we went through the basics of Cargo. With Cargo, we managed to build
basic applications, document them, compile them, and run them. Looking at how clean
and easy this implementation was, it is clear to see why Rust is one of the most favored
languages. Managing all the functionality, documentation, and dependencies in one
file with a few lines of code speeds up the whole process. Combining this with a strict,
helpful compiler makes Rust a no-brainer when it comes to managing complex projects.
We managed our complexity by wrapping our module in easy-to-use interfaces and
interacting with the user's inputs through the command line.

Right now, as you stand, you can start building Rust code to solve a range of problems.
If you want to build an application that interacts as a Rust web server with a frontend
and database, I recommend that you read my other book on web development in Rust,
Rust Web Programming, and start at Chapter 3, as you have now covered enough Rust
fundamentals to start building Rust servers.

In the next chapter of this book, we will cover how to exploit Rust's concurrency.

Questions

1.  As we continue to code, how do we document it?

2.  Why is it important to keep modules isolated to a single concept?

3.  How do we enable our modules to keep the advantages of isolated modules?

it is in?

7.  Let's say that we have changed our mind about our SomeStruct struct in

question 6 and we want it only available in the some_file/ directory. How
would we do this?

8.  How can we access our SomeStruct struct in the some_file/another_

struct.rs file?

Answers     69

Answers

1.  Our docstrings can support Markdown while we are building our structs and
functions. Because it's Markdown, we can document ways in which we can
implement the struct or function. If we are using Visual Studio Code, this also helps
our productivity, as merely hovering the mouse over the function or struct throws
up the documentation.

2.  Keeping our modules constrained to a single concept increases the flexibility of the
application, enabling us to chop and change modules as and when they are needed.

3.

In order to keep our modules isolated, we need to keep the interfaces of the module
the same; this means that we can change logic inside the module without having to
alter anything in the rest of the application. If we delete the module, we only have to
look for implementations of the interface throughout the application as opposed to
the implementation of all functions and structs in the module.

4.  We manage our dependencies in the Cargo.toml file. Just running Cargo will

install the requirements we have when it is compiling before running.

5.  We can account for everything by catching anything that hasn't satisfied all

our matches. This is done by implementing a _ pattern at the end of our match
expression, executing the code attached to that.

6.  We make it publicly available by writing pub mod some_struct; in the

some_file/mod.rs file.

7.  We make it available only in the some_file/ directory by writing mod

some_struct; in the some_file/mod.rs file.

8.  We can access the SomeStruct by typing use super::some_

struct::SomeStruct; in the some_file/another_struct.rs file.

Understanding
Concurrency

Speeding up our code with Rust is useful. However, understanding concurrency and
utilizing threads and processes can take our ability to speed up our code to the next level.
In this chapter, we will go through what processes and threads are. We then go through
the practical steps of spinning up threads and processes in Python and Rust. However,
while this can be exciting, we also must acknowledge that reaching for threads and
processes without thinking about our approach can end up tripping us up. To avoid this,
we also explore algorithm complexity and how this affects our computation time.

In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

•  Introducing concurrency

•  Basic asynchronous programming with threads

•  Running multiple processes

•  Customizing threads and processes safely

Rust/tree/main/chapter_three

Introducing concurrency
As we explored in the introduction of Chapter 1, An Introduction to Rust from a
Python Perspective, Moore's law is now failing, and therefore we have to consider
other ways in which we can speed up our processing. This is where concurrency comes
in. Concurrency is essentially running multiple computations at the same time.
Concurrency is everywhere, and to give the concept full justice, we would have to
write a whole book on it.

However, for the scope of this book, understanding the basics of concurrency
(and when to use it) can add an extra tool to our belt that enables us to speed up
computations. Furthermore, threads and processes are how we can break up our
program into computations that run at the same time. To start our concurrency tour,
we will cover threads.

Threads
Threads are the smallest unit of computation that we can process and manage
independently. Threads are used to break a program into computational parts that can
be run at the same time. It also has to be noted that threads can be run out of sequence.
This brings forward an important distinction between concurrency and parallelism.
Concurrency is the task of running and managing multiple computations at the same
time, while parallelism is the task of running multiple computations at the same time.
Concurrency has a non-deterministic control flow, while parallelism has a deterministic
control flow. Threads share resources such as memory and processing power; however,
they also block each other. For instance, if we spin off a thread that requires constant
processing power, we will merely block the other thread, as seen in the following diagram:

Figure 3.1 – Two threads over time

Introducing concurrency      73

Here, we can see that Thread A stops running when Thread B is running. This is
demonstrated in Pan Wu's 2020 article on understanding multithreading through
simulations where different types of tasks were timed. The results in the article are
summed up in the following chart:

Figure 3.2 – Times of different tasks [Source: Pan Wu, https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-
python-multithreading-and-multiprocessing-via-simulation-3f600dbbfe31]

Here, we can see that the times decrease as the number of workers decreases, apart
from the central processing unit (CPU)-heavy multithreaded tasks. This is because, as
demonstrated in Figure 3.1, the CPU-intensive threads are blocking, so only one worker
can process at a time. It does not matter how many more workers you add. It must be
noted that this is because of Python's global interpreter lock (GIL), which is covered in
Chapter 6, Working with Python Objects in Rust. In other contexts, such as Rust, they can
be executed on different CPU cores and generally will not block each other.

We can also see in Figure 3.2 that the input/output (I/O)-heavy tasks do reduce in
time taken when the workers increase. This is because there is idle time in I/O-heavy
tasks. This is where we can really utilize threads. Let's say our task is making a call to a
server. There is some idle time when waiting for a response, therefore utilizing threads to
make multiple calls to servers will speed up the time. We also must note that processes
work for CPU- and I/O-heavy tasks. Because of this, it is beneficial for us to explore what
processes are.

74     Understanding Concurrency

Processes
Processes are more expensive to produce compared to threads. In fact, a process can host
multiple threads. This is usually depicted in the following classic multithreading diagram,
as seen everywhere (including the multiprocessing Wikimedia page):

Figure 3.3 – Relationship between threads and processes [Source: Cburnett (2007)
(https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Multithreaded_process.svg), CC BY-SA 3.0]

This is a classic diagram because it encapsulates the relationship between processes and
threads so well. Here, we can see that threads are a subset of a process. We can also see
why threads share memory, and as a result, we must note that processes are typically
independent and do not share memory. We also must note that context switches are
more expensive when using processes. A context switch refers to when the state of a
process (or thread) is stored so that it can be restored and resumed at a later state. An
example of this would be waiting for an application programming interface (API)
response. The state can be saved, and another process/thread can run while we wait for
the API response.

Now that we understand the basic concepts behind threads and processes, we need to
learn how to practically use threads in our programs.

Basic asynchronous programming with
threads
To utilize threading, we need to be able to start threads, allow them to run, and then join
them. We can see the stages of practically managing our threads in the following diagram:

Basic asynchronous programming with threads      75

Figure 3.4 – Stages of threads

We start the threads, we then let them run, and once they have run, we join them. If we
did not join them, the program would continue to run before the threads had finished. In
Python, we create a thread by inheriting the Thread object, as follows:

from threading import Thread
from time import sleep
from typing import Optional

class ExampleThread(Thread):

    def __init__(self, seconds: int, name: str) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.seconds: int = seconds
        self.name: str = name
        self._return: Optional[int] = None

    def run(self) -> None:
        print(f"thread {self.name} is running")

76     Understanding Concurrency

        sleep(self.seconds)
        print(f"thread {self.name} has finished")
        self._return = self.seconds

    def join(self) -> int:
        Thread.join(self)
        return self._return

Here, we can see that we have overwritten the run function in the Thread class. This
function runs when the thread is running. We then overwrite the join method. However,
we must note that in the join function, there is extra functionality going on under the
hood; therefore, we must call the Thread class's join method, and then return whatever
we want at the end. We do not have to return anything if we do not want to. If this is the
case, then there is no point overwriting the join function. We can then implement the
threads by running the following code:

one: ExampleThread = ExampleThread(seconds=5, name="one")
two: ExampleThread = ExampleThread(seconds=5, name="two")
three: ExampleThread = ExampleThread(seconds=5,
  name="three")

We then have to time the process of starting, running, and joining the outcomes, like so:

import time

start = time.time()
one.start()
two.start()
three.start()
print("we have started all of our threads")
one_result = one.join()
two_result = two.join()
three_result = three.join()
finish = time.time()
print(f"{finish - start} has elapsed")
print(one_result)
print(two_result)
print(three_result)

When we run this code, we get the following console printout:

Basic asynchronous programming with threads      77

thread one is running
thread two is running
thread three is running
we have started all of our threads
thread one has finished
thread three has finished
thread two has finished
5.005641937255859 has elapsed
5
5
5

Straight away, we can see that it took just over 5 seconds to execute the whole process. If
we were running our program sequentially, it would take 15 seconds. This shows that our
threads are working!

It also must be noted that thread three finished before thread two, even though thread
two started before. Don't worry if you get a finishing sequence of one, two, three;
this is because threads finish in an indeterminate order. Even though the scheduling is
deterministic, there are thousands of events and processes running under the hood of
the CPU when the program is running. As a result, the exact time slices that each thread
gets are never the same. These tiny changes add up over time, and as a result, we cannot
guarantee that the threads will finish in a determinate order if the executions are close and
the durations are roughly the same.

Now we have the basics of Python threads, we can move on to spinning off threads in
Rust. However, before we start doing this, we must understand the concept of closures,
which are essentially a way to store functions anonymously along with the environment it
is part of. Considering this, we can define functions within the scope of the main function
or inside other scopes including other functions. A simple example of a building closure is
to print an input, like this:

fn main() {
    let example_closure: fn(&str) = |string_input: &str| {
        println!("{}", string_input);
    };
    example_closure("this is a closure");
}

78     Understanding Concurrency

With this approach, we can exploit scopes. It also must be noted that as closures are
scope-sensitive, we can also utilize the existing variables around a closure. To demonstrate
this, we can create a closure that calculates the amount of interest we have to pay on a loan
due to the external base rate. We will also define it in an inner scope, as seen here:

fn main() {
        let base_rate: f32 = 0.03;
        let calculate_interest = |loan_amount: &f32| {
            return loan_amount * &base_rate
        };
        println!("the total interest to be paid is: {}",
          calculate_interest(&32567.6));
}

Running this code would give us the following printout in the console:

the total interest to be paid is: 977.02795

Here, we can see that closures can return values, but we have not defined the type for
the closure. This is the case even though it is returning a float. In fact, if we set
calculate_interest to f32, the compiler would complain, stating that the types
were mismatched. This is because the closure is a unique anonymous type that cannot be
written out. A closure is a struct generated by the compiler that houses captured variables.
If we try to call the closure outside the inner scope, our application will fail to compile as
the closure cannot be accessed outside the scope.

Now that we have covered Rust closures, we can replicate the Python threading example
that we covered earlier in the section. Initially, we must import the standard module crates
that are required by running the following code:

use std::{thread, time};
use std::thread::JoinHandle;

We are using thread to spawn off threads, time to keep track of how long our processes
take, and the JoinHandle struct to join the threads. With these imports, we can build
our own thread by running the following code:

fn simple_thread(seconds: i8, name: &str) -> i8 {
    println!("thread {} is running", name);
    let total_seconds = time::Duration::new(seconds as \
      u64, 0);

Basic asynchronous programming with threads      79

    thread::sleep(total_seconds);
    println!("thread {} has finished", name);
    return seconds
}

Here, we can see that we create a Duration struct denoted as total_seconds. We
then use the thread and total_seconds to put the function to sleep, returning the
number of seconds when the whole process is finished. Right now, this is just a function,
and running it by itself will not spin off different threads. Inside our main function, we
start our timer and spawn off our three threads by running the following code:

let now = time::Instant::now();

let thread_one: JoinHandle<i8> = thread::spawn(|| {
    simple_thread(5, "one")});
let thread_two: JoinHandle<i8> = thread::spawn(|| {
    simple_thread(5, "two")});
let thread_three: JoinHandle<i8> = thread::spawn(|| {
    simple_thread(5, "three")});

Here, we spawn threads and pass our function in with the right parameters in the closure.
Nothing is stopping us from putting any code in the closure. The final line in the closure
would be what is returned to the JoinHandle struct to unwrap. Once this is done, we
join all the threads to hold the program until all the threads have finished before moving
on with this code:

let result_one = thread_one.join();
let result_two = thread_two.join();
let result_three = thread_three.join();

The join function returns a result with the Result<i8, Box<dyn Any +
Send>> type.

There are some new concepts here, but we can break them down, as follows:

•  We remember that a Result struct in Rust either returns an Ok or an Err

response. If the thread runs without any problems, then we will return the i8 value
that we are expecting. If not, then we have this rather ugly Result<i8, Box<dyn
Any + Send>> output as the error.

80     Understanding Concurrency

•  The first thing we must address here is the Box struct. This is one of the most basic
forms of a pointer and allows us to store data on the heap rather than the stack.
What remains on the stack is the pointer to the data in the heap. We are using this
because we do not know how big the data is when coming out of the thread.

•  The next expression that we must explain is dyn. This keyword is used to indicate
that the type is a trait object. For instance, we might want to store a range of Box
structs in an array. These Box structs might point to different structs. However,
we can still ensure that they can be grouped together if they have a certain trait
in common. For instance, if all the structs had to have TraitA implemented, we
would denote this with Box<dyn TraitA>.

•  The Any keyword is a trait for dynamic typing. This means that the data type can
be anything. The Any trait is combined with Send by using the Any + Send
expression. This means that both traits must be implemented.

•  The Send trait is for types that can be transferred across thread boundaries. Send
is implemented automatically by the compiler if it is deemed appropriate. With all
this, we can confidently state that the join of a thread in Rust returns a result that
can either be the integer that we desire or a pointer to anything else that can be
transferred across threads.

To process the results of the thread, we could just directly unwrap them. However, this
would not be very useful when the demands of our multithreaded programs increase.
We must be able to handle what potentially comes out of a thread, and to do this, we are
going to have to downcast the outcome. Downcasting is Rust's method of converting a
trait into a concrete type. In this context, we will be converting PyO3 structs that denote
Python types into concrete Rust data types such as strings or integers. To demonstrate
this, let's build a function that handles the outcome of our thread, as follows:

1.  First, we are going to have to import everything we need, as seen in the following

code snippet:

use std::any::Any;
use std::marker::Send;

2.  With these imports, we can create a function that unpacks the result and prints it

using this code:

fn process_thread(thread_result: Result<i8, Box<dyn \
  Any + Send>>, name: &str) {
    match thread_result {
        Ok(result) => {

Basic asynchronous programming with threads      81

            println!("the result for {} is {}", \
              result, name);
        }
        Err(result) => {
            if let Some(string) = result.downcast \
              _ref::<String>() {
                println!("the error for {} is: {}", \
                  name, string);
            } else {
                println!("there error for {} does \
                  not have a message", name);
            }
        }
    }
}

3.  Here, we merely print out the result if it is a success. However, if it is an error,

as pointed out earlier, we do not know what data type the error is. However, we
would still like to handle this. This is where we downcast. Downcasting returns
an option, which is why we have the if let Some(string) = result.
downcast_ref::<String>() condition. If the downcast is successful, we can
move the string into the scope and print out the error string. If it is not successful,
we can move on and state that although there was an error, an error string was
not provided. We can use multiple conditional statements to account for a range
of data types if we want. We can write a lot of Rust code without having to rely on
downcasting, as Rust has a strict typing section. However, when interfacing with
Python this can be useful, as we know that Python objects are dynamic and could
essentially be anything.

4.  Now that we can process our threads when they have finished, we can stop the clock

and process the outcomes by running the following code:

println!("time elapsed {:?}", now.elapsed());
process_thread(result_one, "one");
process_thread(result_two, "two");
process_thread(result_three, "three");

82     Understanding Concurrency

5.  This gives us the following printout:

thread one is running
thread three is running
thread two is running
thread one has finished
thread three has finished
thread two has finished
time elapsed 5.00525725s
the result for 5 is one
the result for 5 is two
the result for 5 is three

And here we have it: we can run and process threads in Python and Rust. However,
remember that if we try to run CPU-intensive tasks with the code that we have written, we
will not get the speed up. However, it must be noted that in the Rust context of the code,
there could be a speedup depending on the environment. For instance, if multiple CPU
cores are available, the operating system (OS) scheduler can put those threads onto those
cores to be executed in parallel. To write code that will speed up our code in this context,
we will have to learn how to practically spin up multiple processes, which we cover in the
next section.

Running multiple processes
Technically with Python, we can simply switch the inheritance of our thread from
Thread to Process by running the following code:

from multiprocessing import Process
from typing import Optional

class ExampleProcess(Process):

    def __init__(self, seconds: int, name: str) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.seconds: int = seconds

Running multiple processes      83

        self.name: str = name
        self._return: Optional[int] = None

    def run(self) -> None:
        # do something demanding of the CPU
        pass

    def join(self) -> int:
        Process.join(self)
        return self._return

However, there are some compilations. If we refer to Figure 3.3, we can see that processes
have their own memory. This is where things can get complicated.

For instance, there is nothing wrong with the process defined previously if the process is
not returning anything directly but writing to a database or file. On the other hand, the
join function will not return anything directly and will just have None instead. This is
because Process is not sharing the same memory space as the main process. We also
must remember that spinning off processes is more expensive, so we must be more careful
with this.

Since we are getting more complex with the memory and the resources are getting more
expensive, it makes sense to rein it in and keep it simple. This is where we utilize a pool.
A pool is where we have several workers processing inputs simultaneously and then
packaging them as an array, as seen here:

Figure 3.5 – Pool of processes

84     Understanding Concurrency

The advantage here is that we keep the expensive multiprocessing context to a small part
of the program. We can also easily control the number of workers that we are willing to
support. For Python, this means that we keep the interaction as lightweight as possible.
As seen in the next diagram, we package an individual isolated function in a tuple with an
array of inputs. This tuple gets processed in the pool by a worker, and then the result of the
outcome is returned from the pool:

Figure 3.6 – Pool data flow

To demonstrate multiprocessing via a pool, we can utilize the Fibonacci sequence. This is
where the next number of the sequence is the sum of the previous number in the sequence
and the number before that, as illustrated here:

To calculate a number in the sequence, we will have to use recursion. There is a closed
𝐹𝐹𝑛𝑛 = 𝐹𝐹𝑛𝑛−1 + 𝐹𝐹𝑛𝑛−2
form of the Fibonacci sequence; however, this will not let us explore multiprocessing as
the closed sequence by its very nature doesn't scale in computation as n increases. To
calculate a Fibonacci number in Python, we can write an isolated function, as seen in the
following code snippet:

def recur_fibo(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return (recur_fibo(n-1) + recur_fibo(n-2))

This function keeps going back until it hits the bottom of the tree at either 1 or 0.
This function is terrible at scaling. To demonstrate this, let's look at the recursion tree
shown here:

Running multiple processes      85

Figure 3.7 – Fibonacci recursion tree

We can see that these are not perfect trees, and if you go online and search for big O
notation of the Fibonacci sequence, there are debates, and some equations will equate the
scaling factor to the golden ratio. While this is interesting, it is outside the scope of this
book as we are focusing on computational complexity. As a result, we will simplify the
math and treat this as a perfectly symmetrical tree. Recursion trees scale at the rate of
where n is the depth of the tree. Referring to Figure 3.7, we can see that if we treat the
2
tree as perfectly symmetrical, a n value of 3 has a depth of 3, and a n value of 4 has a depth
of 4. As n increases, the computation increases exponentially.

 ,
𝑛𝑛

We have taken a slight detour of complexity to highlight the importance of taking this
into account before reaching for multiprocessing. The reason why you bought this book
as opposed to searching online for multiprocessing code snippets to copy and paste into
your code is that you want to be guided through these concepts with pointers for further
reading and an appreciation of their context. In the case of this sequence, reaching for a
closed form or caching answers would reduce the computation time greatly. If we have
an ordered list of numbers, getting the highest number in the list and then creating a full
sequence up to the highest number would be a lot quicker than repeatedly calculating
the sequence again and again for each number we want to calculate. Avoiding recursion
altogether is a better option than reaching for multiprocessing.

86     Understanding Concurrency

To implement and test our multiprocessing pool, we first need to time how long it would
take to calculate a range of numbers sequentially. This can be done like so:

import time

start = time.time()
recur_fibo(n=8)
recur_fibo(n=12)
recur_fibo(n=12)
recur_fibo(n=20)
recur_fibo(n=20)
recur_fibo(n=20)
recur_fibo(n=20)
recur_fibo(n=28)
recur_fibo(n=28)
recur_fibo(n=28)
recur_fibo(n=28)
recur_fibo(n=36)
finish = time.time()
print(f"{finish - start} has elapsed")

We have introduced a pretty long list; however, this is essential to see the difference. If we
just had two Fibonacci numbers to compute, then the cost of spinning up processes could
eclipse the gain in multiprocessing.

Our multiple processing pool can be implemented as follows:

if __name__ == '__main__':
    from multiprocessing import Pool

    start = time.time()
    with Pool(4) as p:
        print(p.starmap(recur_fibo, [(8,), (12,), (12,), \
         (20,), (20,), (20,), (20,), (28,), (28,), (28,), \
           (28,),(36,)]))
    finish = time.time()
    print(f"{finish - start} has elapsed")

Running multiple processes      87

Please note that we have nested this code under if __name__ == "__main__":. This
is because the whole script gets run again when spinning up another process, which can
result in infinite loops. If the code is nested under if __name__ == "__main__":
then it will not run again as there is only one main process. It also must be noted that
we defined a pool of four workers. This can be changed to whatever we feel fit but there
are diminishing returns when increasing this, as we will explore later. The tuples in the
list are the arguments for each computation. Running the whole script gives us the
following output:

3.2531330585479736 has elapsed
[21, 144, 144, 6765, 6765, 6765, 6765, 317811,
317811, 317811, 317811, 14930352]
3.100019931793213 has elapsed

We can see that the speed is not a quarter of the sequential calculations. However, the
multiprocessing pool is slightly faster. If you run this multiple times, you will get some
variance in the difference in times. However, the multiprocessing approach will always
be faster. Now that we have run a multiprocessing tool in Python, we can implement our
Fibonacci multithreading in the different context of a multiprocessing pool in Rust. Here's
how we'll do this:

1.

In our new Cargo project, we can code the following function in our main.rs file:

pub fn fibonacci_recursive(n: i32) -> u64 {
     if n < 0 {
          panic!("{} is negative!", n);
     }
     match n {
           0     => panic!(
           "zero is not a right argument to
           fibonacci_reccursive()!"),
           1 | 2 => 1,
           _     => fibonacci_reccursive(n - 1) +
                    fibonacci_reccursive(n - 2)
}
}

We can see that our Rust function is not more complex than our Python version.
The extra lines of code are just to account for unexpected inputs.

88     Understanding Concurrency

2.  To run this and time it, we must import the time crate at the top of the main.rs

file by running the following code:

use std::time;

3.  Then, we must compute the exact same Fibonacci numbers as we did in the Python

implementation, as follows:

fn main() {
    let now = time::Instant::now();
    fibonacci_reccursive(8);
    fibonacci_reccursive(12);
    fibonacci_reccursive(12);
    fibonacci_reccursive(20);
    fibonacci_reccursive(20);
    fibonacci_reccursive(20);
    fibonacci_reccursive(20);
    fibonacci_reccursive(28);
    fibonacci_reccursive(28);
    fibonacci_reccursive(28);
    fibonacci_reccursive(28);
    fibonacci_reccursive(36);
    println!("time elapsed {:?}", now.elapsed());
}

4.  To run this, we are going to use the following command:

cargo run –release

5.  We are going to use the release version as that is what we will be using in

production. Running it gives us the following output:

time elapsed 40.754875ms

Running this several times will give us an average roundabout of 40 milliseconds.
Considering that our multiprocessing Python code ran at roughly 3.1 seconds, our Rust
single-threaded implementation runs 77 times faster than our Python multiprocessing
code. Just let that sink in! The code was not more complex, and it is memory-safe.
Therefore, fusing Rust with Python is such a quick win! Combining the aggressive typing
with the compiler forces us to account for every input and outcome, and we are on the
way to turbocharging our Python systems with safer, faster code.

Running multiple processes      89

Now, we are going to see what happens to the speed when we run our numbers through
a multithreading tool. Here's how we'll go about this:

1.  To do this, we are going to use the rayon crate. We define this dependency in our

Cargo.toml file by running the following code:

[dependencies]
rayon="1.5.0"

2.  Once this is done, we import it into our main.rs file, as follows:

use rayon::prelude::*;

3.  We can then run our multithreading pool in our main function below our

sequential calculations by running the following code:

rayon::ThreadPoolBuilder::new().num_threads(4) \
  .build_global().unwrap();

let now = time::Instant::now();
let numbers: Vec<i32> = vec![8, 12, 12, 20, 20, 20, \
  20, 28, 28, 28, 28, 36];
let outcomes: Vec<u64> = numbers.into_par_iter() \
  .map(|n| fibonacci_reccursive(n)).collect();
println!("{:?}", outcomes);
println!("time elapsed {:?}", now.elapsed());

4.  Here, we define the number of threads that our pool builder has. We then execute
the into_par_iter function on the vector. This is achieved by implementing
the IntoParallelIterator trait onto the vector, which is done when the
rayon crate is imported. If it were not imported, then the compiler would
complain, stating that a vector does not have the into_par_iter function
associated with it.

5.  We then map our Fibonacci function over the integers in the vector utilizing

a closure and collect them. The calculated Fibonacci numbers are associated with
the outcomes variable.

6.  We then print them and print the time elapsed. Running this via a release gives us

the following printout in the console:

time elapsed 38.993791ms
[21, 144, 144, 6765, 6765, 6765, 6765, 317811,

90     Understanding Concurrency

317811, 317811, 317811, 14930352]
time elapsed 31.493291ms

Running this several times will give you roughly the times stated in the preceding
console printout. Calculating this gives us a 20% increase in speed. Considering that
the Python multiprocessing only gave us a 5% increase, we can deduce that Rust is
also more efficient at multithreading when the right context is applied.

We can go a little further to really see the advantages of these pools. Remember
that our sequence increases exponentially. In our Rust program, we can add three
computations for n being 46 to our sequential calculations and pooled calculations,
and we get the following output:

time elapsed 12.5856675s
[21, 144, 144, 6765, 6765, 6765, 6765, 317811, 317811,
317811, 317811, 14930352, 1836311903, 1836311903,
1836311903]
time elapsed 4.0485755s

First, we must acknowledge that the time went from milliseconds to double-digit
seconds. Exponential scaling algorithms are painful, and just adding 10 to your
calculation pushes it up greatly. We can also see that our savings have increased.
Our pooled calculations are now 3.11 times faster as opposed to 1.2 times faster in
the previous test!

7.

If we add three extra computations for n being 46 for our Python implementation,
we get the following console printout:

1105.5351197719574 has elapsed
[21, 144, 144, 6765, 6765, 6765, 6765, 317811, 317811,
317811, 317811, 14930352, 1836311903, 1836311903,
1836311903]
387.0687129497528 has elapsed

Here, we can see that our Python pooled processing is 2.85 times faster than our Python
sequential processing. We also must note here that our Rust sequential processing
is roughly 95 times faster than our Python sequential processing, and our Rust pool
multithreading is roughly 96 times faster than our Python pool processing. As the number
of points that need processing increases, so will the difference. This highlights even more
motivation for plugging Rust into Python.

Running multiple processes      91

It must be noted that we got our speed increase in our Rust program through
multithreading as opposed to multiprocessing. Multiprocessing in Rust is not as
straightforward as in Python—this is mainly down to Rust being a newer language. For
instance, there is a crate called mitosis that will enable us to run functions in a separate
process; however, this crate only has four contributors, and the last contribution at the
time of writing this book was 13 months ago. Considering this, we should approach
multiprocessing in Rust without any third-party crates. To achieve this, we need to code
a Fibonacci calculation program and a multiprocessing program that will call this in
different processes, as seen in the following diagram:

Figure 3.8 – Multiprocessing in Rust

We are going to pass our data into these processes and parse the outputs handling them in
our multiprocessing.rs file. To carry this out in the simplest way, we code both files
in the same directory. First, we build our fib_process.rs file. We must import what
we are going to do by running the following code:

use std::env;
use std::vec::Vec;

We want our processes to accept a list of integers to calculate, so we define Fibonacci
number and numbers functions, as follows:

pub fn fibonacci_number(n: i32) -> u64 {
      if n < 0 {
           panic!("{} is negative!", n);
      }
      match n {
           0     => panic!("zero is not a right argument \
                             to fibonacci_number!"),
           1 | 2 => 1,

92     Understanding Concurrency

           _     => fibonacci_number(n - 1) +
                    fibonacci_number(n - 2)
      }
}
pub fn fibonacci_numbers(numbers: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<u64> {
    let mut vec: Vec<u64> = Vec::new();

    for n in numbers.iter() {
        vec.push(fibonacci_number(*n));
    }
    return vec
}

We have seen these functions before as they have become the standard way to calculate
Fibonacci numbers in this book. We now must take a list of integers from arguments,
parse them into integers, pass them into our calculation function, and return the results,
as follows:

fn main() {
    let mut inputs: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
    for i in args {
        match i.parse::<i32>() {
            Ok(result) => inputs.push(result),
            Err(_) => (),
        }
    }
    let results = fibonacci_numbers(inputs);
    for i in results {
        println!("{}", i);
    }
}

Running multiple processes      93

Here, we can see that we collect the input from the environment. Once the input integers
have been parsed into i32 integers and used to calculate the Fibonacci numbers, we
merely print them out. Printing out to the console generally acts as stdout. Our process
file is fully coded, so we can compile it with the following command:

rustc fib_process.rs

This creates a binary of our file. Now that this is done, we can move on to our
multiprocessing.rs file that will spawn multiple processes. We import what we need
by running the following code:

use std::process::{Command, Stdio, Child};
use std::io::{BufReader, BufRead};

The Command struct is going to be used to spawn off a new process, the Stdio struct
is going to be used to define the piping of data back from the process, and the Child
struct is returned when the process is spawned. We will use them to access the output
data and get the process to wait to finish. The BufReader struct is used to read the data
from the child process. Now that we have imported everything we need, we can define
a function that accepts an array of integers as strings and spins off the process, returning
the Child struct, as follows:

fn spawn_process(inputs: &[&str]) -> Child {
    return Command::new("./fib_process").args(inputs)
    .stdout(Stdio::piped())
    .spawn().expect("failed to execute process")
}

Here, we can see that we just must call our binary and pass in our array of strings in
the args function. We then define the stdout and spawn the process, returning the
Child struct. Now that this is done, we can fire off three processes in our main function
and wait for them to complete by running the following code:

fn main() {
    let mut one = spawn_process(&["5", "6", "7", "8"]);
    let mut two = spawn_process(&["9", "10", "11", "12"]);
    let mut three = spawn_process(&["13", "14", "15", \
      "16"]);

    one.wait();
    two.wait();

94     Understanding Concurrency

    three.wait();
}

We can now start extracting the data from these processes inside our main function by
running the following code:

    let one_stdout = one.stdout.as_mut().expect(
        "unable to open stdout of child");
    let two_stdout = two.stdout.as_mut().expect(
        "unable to open stdout of child");
    let three_stdout = three.stdout.as_mut().expect
    ("unable to open stdout of child");

    let one_data = BufReader::new(one_stdout);
    let two_data = BufReader::new(two_stdout);
    let three_data = BufReader::new(three_stdout);

Here, we can see that we have accessed the data using the stdout field, and then
processed it using the BufReader struct. We can then loop through our extracted data,
appending it to an empty vector and then printing it out by running the following code:

    let mut results = Vec::new();
    for i in three_data.lines() {
        results.push(i.unwrap().parse::<i32>().unwrap());
    }
    for i in one_data.lines() {
        results.push(i.unwrap().parse::<i32>().unwrap());
    }
    for i in two_data.lines() {
        results.push(i.unwrap().parse::<i32>().unwrap());
    }
    println!("{:?}", results);

This code is a little repetitive, but it illustrates how to spawn and manage multiple
processes in Rust. We then compile the file with the following command:

rustc fib_multiprocessing.rs

Customizing threads and processes safely     95

We can then run our multiprocessing code with the following command:

./multiprocessing

We then get the output, as follows:

[233, 377, 610, 987, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144] we have
  it, our multiprocessing code in Rust works.

We have now covered all we need to know about running processes and threads to speed
up our computations. However, we need to be mindful and investigate how to customize
our threads and processes safely to avoid pitfalls.

Customizing threads and processes safely
In this section, we will cover some of the pitfalls that we have to avoid when being
creative with threads and processes. We will not cover the concepts in depth, as advanced
multiprocessing and concurrency is a big topic and there are books completely dedicated
to this. However, it is important to understand what to look out for and which topics to
read if you want to increase your knowledge of multiprocessing/threading.

Looking back at our Fibonacci sequences, it might be tempting to spin off extra threads
inside our thread to speed up the individual computations in the thread pool. However, to
truly understand if this is a good idea, we need to understand Amdahl's law.

Amdahl's law
Amdahl's law lets us describe the trade-off on adding more threads. If we spin off threads
inside the threads, we will have exponential growth of threads. You may be forgiven for
thinking this to be a good idea; however, Amdahl's law states that there are diminishing
returns when increasing the cores. Have a look at the following formula:

Here, the following applies:

𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑠𝑠) =

1

(1 − 𝑆𝑆) +

𝑆𝑆
𝑠𝑠

•  Speed: This is the theoretical speedup of the execution of the whole task.

•  s: This is the speedup of the part of the task that benefits from improved system

resources.

•  p: This is the proportion of execution time that the part benefiting from improved

resources originally occupied.

96     Understanding Concurrency

In general, increasing the cores does have an impact; however, the diminishing returns
can be seen in the following screenshot:

Figure 3.9 – Diminishing returns through Amdahl's law [Source: Daniels220
(https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6678551), CC BY-SA 3.0]

Considering this, we might want to investigate using a broker to manage our
multiprocessing. However, this can lead to using clogging up the broker, resulting in
deadlock. To understand the gravity of this situation, we will explore deadlocks in the
next section.

Deadlocks
Deadlocks can arise when it comes to bigger applications, where it is common to manage
the multiprocessing through a task broker. This is usually managed via a database or
caching mechanism such as Redis. This consists of a queue where the tasks are added, as
illustrated here:

Customizing threads and processes safely     97

Figure 3.10 – The flow of tasks when multiprocessing with a broker or queue

Here, we can see that new tasks can be added to the queue. As time goes on, the oldest
tasks get taken off the queue and passed into the pool. Throughout the application, our
code can send functions and parameters to the queue anywhere in the application.

In Python, the library that does this is called Celery. There is also a Celery crate for Rust.
This approach is also utilized for multiple server setups. Considering this, we could be
tempted to send tasks to the queue inside another task. However, we can see here that this
approach can lock up our queue:

Figure 3.11 – Deadlock with task broker

98     Understanding Concurrency

In Figure 3.11, we can see that the tasks in the pool have sent tasks to the queue. However,
they cannot complete until their dependencies have been executed. The thing is, they will
never execute because the pool is full of tasks waiting for their dependency to complete
and the pool is full, so they cannot be processed. The issue with this problem is that there
are no errors raised with this—the pool will just hang. Deadlock is not the only problem
that will arise without helpful warnings. Considering this, we must cover our last concept
that we should be aware of before being creative: race conditions.

Race conditions
Race conditions occur when two or more threads access shared data that they both
try to change. As we have noted when we were building and running our threads, they
sometimes ran out of order. We can demonstrate this with a simple concept, as follows:

•  If we were to have thread one calculate a price and write to a file and thread two to
also calculate a price, read the price calculated from the thread one file, and add
them together, there could be a chance that the price will not be written to the file
before thread two reads it. What is even worse is that there could be an old price in
the file. If this is the case, we will never know that the error occurred. The term race
conditions is built upon the fact that both threads are racing to the data.

As a solution to race conditions, we can introduce locks. Locks can be utilized for
stopping other threads from accessing certain things such as a file until your thread has
finished with it. However, it has to be noted that these locks only work inside the process;
therefore, other processes can access the file. Caching solutions such as Redis and general
databases have already implemented these safeguards, and locks will not protect against
the race condition described in this section. In my experience, when we get creative with
thread concepts such as locks, it is usually a sign that we must take a step back and rethink
our design.

Even an SQLite database file will manage our data race issues when reading and writing
to a file, and if the data race condition described at the start of this section looks like it
might happen, it is best to just not have them running at the same time at all. Sequential
programming is safer and more useful.

Summary     99

Summary
In this chapter, we went through the basics of multiprocessing and multithreading. We
then went through practical ways to utilize threads and processes. We then explored the
Fibonacci sequence to explore how processes can speed up our computations. We also saw
through the Fibonacci sequence that how we compute our problems is the biggest factor
over threads and processes. Algorithms that scale exponentially should be avoided before
reaching for multiprocessing for speed gains. We must remember that while it might
be tempting to reach for more complex approaches to multiprocessing, this can lead to
problems such as deadlock and data races. We kept our multiprocessing tight by keeping
it contained within a processing pool. If we keep these principles in mind and keep all
our multiprocessing contained to a pool, we will keep our hard-to-diagnose problems to
a minimum. This does not mean that we should never be creative with multiprocessing
but it is advised to do further reading on this field, as there are books entirely dedicated
to concurrency (as noted in the Further reading section, with particular chapters to focus
on). This is just an introduction to enable us to use concurrency in our Python packages if
needed. In the next chapter, we will be building our own Python packages so that we can
distribute our Python code across multiple projects and reuse code.

Questions

1.  What is the difference between a process and a thread?

2.  Why wouldn't multithreading speed up our Python Fibonacci sequence

calculations?

3.  Why is a multiprocessing pool used?
4.  Our threads in Rust return Result<i8, Box<dyn Any + Send>>. What does

this mean?

5.  Why should we avoid using a recursion tree if we can?

6.  Should you just spin up more processes when you need a faster runtime?

7.  Why should you avoid complex multiprocessing if you can?
8.  What does join do for our program in multithreading?
9.  Why does join not return anything in a process?

100     Understanding Concurrency

Answers

1.  Threads are lightweight and enable multithreading, where we can run multiple
tasks that could have idle time. A process is more expensive, enabling us to run
multiple CPU-heavy tasks at the same time. Processes do not share memory,
while threads do.

2.  Multithreading would not speed up our Fibonacci sequence calculations because
calculating Fibonacci numbers is a CPU-heavy task that does not have any
idle time; therefore, the threads would run sequentially in Python. However,
we did demonstrate that Rust can run multiple threads at the same time, getting
a significant speed increase.

3.  Multiprocessing is expensive and the processes do not share memory, making
the implementation potentially more complex. A processing pool keeps the
multiprocessing part of a program to a minimum. This approach also enables us to
easily control the different numbers of workers we need as they're all in one place,
and we can also return all the outcomes in the same sequence as they are returned
from the multiprocessing pool.

4.  Our Rust thread could fail. If it doesn't, then it will return an integer. If it fails, it

could return anything of any size, which is why it's on the heap. It also has the Send
trait, which means that it can be sent across threads.

5.  Recursion trees scale exponentially. Even if we are multithreading, our computation
time will quickly scale, pushing our milliseconds into seconds once we've crossed
a boundary.

6.  No—as demonstrated in Amdahl's law, increasing the workers will give us some

speedup, but we will have diminishing returns as the number of workers increases.

7.  Complex multiprocessing/multithreading can introduce a range of silent errors such

as deadlock and data races that can be hard to diagnose and solve.

8.  join blocks the program until the thread has completed. It can also return the

result of the thread if we overwrite Python's join function.

9.  Processes do not share the same memory space, therefore they cannot be accessed.
We can, however, access data from other processes by saving data to files for our
main process to access or pipe data via stdin and stdout, as we did in our Rust
multiprocessing example.

Fusing Rust
with Python

Now that you are familiar with Rust, we can start utilizing it. Before we do this, we need
to cover how to build Python packages that can be installed with pip. Once this has
been done, we can build Python pip modules in Rust. This is where we can import our
compiled Rust code into our Python code and run it with all the benefits of Rust in our
Python application. We then go further into this by working with Python objects and
using Python modules inside the Rust code.

This section comprises the following chapters:

•  Chapter 4, Building pip Modules in Python

•  Chapter 5, Creating a Rust Interface for Our pip Module

•  Chapter 6, Working with Python Objects in Rust

•  Chapter 7, Using Python Modules in Rust

•  Chapter 8, Structuring an End-to-End Python Module in Rust

Building pip
Modules in Python

Writing code to solve our problems is useful. However, writing code can become repetitive
and time-consuming, especially when we are building applications. Applications usually
require defining the steps that build the application. Packaging our code can help us
reuse our code and share it with other developers. In this chapter, we will package
Fibonacci code into a Python pip module that can be easily installed and has a
command-line tool. We will also cover continuous integration processes that deploy
our packages once a merge has been achieved to our main branch.

In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

•  Configuring setup tools for a Python pip module

•  Packaging Python code in a pip module

•  Configuring continuous integration

Technical requirements
We will need to have Python 3 installed. To get the most out of this chapter, we will
also need to have a GitHub account, as we will be using GitHub to package our code,
which can be accessed via this link: https://github.com/maxwellflitton/
flitton-fib-py.

106     Building pip Modules in Python

Git command-line tools are also needed in this chapter. These can be installed by
following the instructions here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-
Started-Installing-Git. The chapter will also make use of a PyPI account.
You will need to have your own PyPI account, which can be obtained for free with
this link: https://pypi.org/.

Configuring setup tools for a Python pip
module
Setup tools in Python are how the code in our module is packaged and installed. They
provide a set of commands and parameters for the system that is installing the code to
process. To explore how this is done, we will package the Fibonacci numbers example
introduced in the previous chapter. However, these calculations will be packaged in
a pip module. To configure our setup tools, we are going to have to carry out the
following steps:

1.  Create a GitHub repository for our Python pip package.

2.  Define basic parameters.
3.  Define a README file.

4.  Define a basic module structure.

Let's have a look at each of these steps in detail in the following subsections.

Creating a GitHub repository
Understandably, a seasoned developer can create a GitHub repository but for the sake
of completeness, we will offer all the steps needed. If you can already create a GitHub
repository, move on to the next subsection:

1.  On the home URL of GitHub when we are logged in, we can create our repository

by clicking on the New button, as shown here:

Configuring setup tools for a Python pip module     107

Figure 4.1 – How to create a new repository on GitHub

2.  Once this is clicked, we can configure our new repository with the parameters

shown next:

Figure 4.2 – Parameters for our new GitHub repository

108     Building pip Modules in Python

For this example, we have set the GitHub repository to Public; however, our pip
packaging for this chapter will also work the same way for private repositories.
We have also included a .gitignore file and selected it to be Python. This is to
stop Python caching and for virtual environment files to be tracked by GitHub and
uploaded when we upload our code to the repository. Now that we have our GitHub
repository made, going to the repository will look like this:

Figure 4.3 – Our GitHub repository home page

We can see that our description is written in the README.md file. It also has to be
noted that the README.md file is rendered. This happens in any directory of the
repository. We can document what to do and how to use the code throughout the
repository with a range of README.md files if we want.

3.  Once this is done, we can download our repository with the command shown next:

git clone https://github.com/maxwellflitton/flitton-
  fib-py.git

Your URL will be different, as you have a different repository. The only thing left
is to ensure that our development environment for our repository has a Python
virtual environment.

4.  This can be done by navigating to the root directory of the GitHub repository and

then running the command shown here:

python3 -m venv venv

Configuring setup tools for a Python pip module     109

This creates a Python virtual environment under the venv directory in the root
directory. We have to use the venv directory, as this is automatically included
in the .gitignore file. However, there is nothing stopping us from calling it
what we want, as long as we include it in the .gitignore file. However, venv
is the convention, and using this will avoid confusion with other developers. Our
environment is now fully set up.

5.  To use our virtual environment in the terminal, we can activate it with the

command shown next:

source venv/bin/activate

We can see that our command is prefixed with (venv), meaning that it is active.

Defining the basic parameters
Now that our environment is fully functional, we are going to define the basic parameters
when installing our Python pip module:

1.  This is achieved by creating a setup.py file in the root of our repository. This will
get run when another Python system installs our pip module. In our setup.py
file, we import our setup tools with the code shown here:

from setuptools import find_packages, setup

We are going to use setup to define our parameters, and we are going to use
find_packages to exclude tests.

2.  Now that we have imported our setup tools, we can define our parameters in the

same file with the code shown here:

setup(
    name="flitton_fib_py",
    version="0.0.1",
    author="Maxwell Flitton",
    author_email="maxwell@gmail.com",
    description="Calculates a Fibonacci number",
    long_description="A basic library that \
      calculates Fibonacci numbers",
    long_description_content_type="text/markdown",
    url="https://github.com/maxwellflitton/flitton- \
      fib-py",

110     Building pip Modules in Python

    install_requires=[],
    packages=find_packages(exclude=("tests",)),
    classifiers=[
        "Development Status :: 4 - Beta",
        "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
        "Operating System :: OS Independent",
    ],
    python_requires='>=3',
    tests_require=['pytest'],
)

There are a lot of parameters here. What we have done from the name field to url
is essentially define the metadata around our pip module. The classifiers
fields are also metadata around our module. The rest of the fields have the
following effects:
  The Install_requires field is currently an empty list. This is because our
module is not requiring any third-party modules right now. We will cover
dependencies in Managing dependencies section.

  The packages field ensures that we exclude our test directory when we start
building our tests for our module. While we will use tests to check our module
and ensure standards, we do not need to install them when we are using our
module as a third-party dependency.

  The Python_requires field ensures that the system installing our module has

the correct version of Python installed.

  tests_require is a list of requirements when tests are running.

3.  Now that we have defined our basic setup, we can upload our code with the

following commands:

git add -A
git commit -m "adding setup to module"
git push origin main

What we have done here is add all of the new and changed files to our Git branch
(which is main). We then committed our files with the adding setup to module
message. We then pushed our code to the main branch, which means that we uploaded
our changes onto the Git repository online. This is not the best way to manage our code
iterations. We will go over different branches and how to manage them in the continuous
integration section near the end of this chapter.

Configuring setup tools for a Python pip module     111

You may have noticed that long_description is a Markdown; however, trying to fit
an entire Markdown into this field would end up dominating the setup.py file. It would
essentially be a long string spanning multiple lines, with a few Python lines dispersed
into it. We want our setup.py file to dictate the logic of setting up the module when
it is being installed. We also want our long description of the module to be rendered by
GitHub when we visit the GitHub repository directly online. Because of this, we will need
to add some extra logic around defining our long description in the next section.

Defining a README file
Our long description is essentially the README.md file. If we fuse this with our
setup.py, our README.md file will also render if we visit it on PyPI and it is uploaded
to the PyPI server. This can be done by reading the README.md file into a string in the
setup.py file and then plugging that string into our long_description field with
the following code in the setup.py file:

with open("README.md", "r") as fh:
    long_description = fh.read()

setup(
    name="flitton_fib_py",
    version="0.0.1",
    author="Maxwell Flitton",
    author_email="maxwell@gmail.com",
    description="Calculates a Fibonacci number",
    long_description=long_description,
    ...

The rest of the code after ... is the same as before. With this, our basic module setup is
complete. Now, all we need is to do is define a basic module to install and use, which is
what we will do in the next step.

Defining a basic module
Defining a basic module takes the following structure:

├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── flitton_fib_py
│   └── __init__.py

112     Building pip Modules in Python

├── setup.py
└── venv

We house the actual code that the user will have in our flitton_fib_py directory. For
now, we are just going to have a basic function that prints something out so that we can
see if our pip package works. Here are the steps:

1.  We do this by adding a basic print function in the flitton_fib_py/__

init__.py file that has the following code:

def say_hello() -> None:
    print("the Flitton Fibonacci module is saying hello")

Once this is done, we can upload the code to the GitHub repository using the
git commands described in the Packaging Python code in a pip module section.
We should now see all the code of our module in the main branch. Considering
this, we need to navigate to another directory that is not associated with our git
repository.

2.  We then unlink our virtual environment by typing the following command:

deactivate

We can then create a new virtual environment using the steps covered in the first
section and activate it. Now, we are ready to install our package in our new virtual
environment using pip install and check to see whether it works.

3.  To use pip install, we point to the URL of the GitHub repository that our pip
module is stored and define which branch it is. We do this by typing the following
command, all in one line:

pip install git+https://github.com/maxwellflitton/
  flitton-fib-py@main

Your GitHub repository will have a different URL and you might have a different
directory. Running this command will give us a range of printouts, stating that it is
cloning the repository and installing it.

4.  We then open up a Python terminal by typing in the following command:

python

Packaging Python code in a pip module     113

5.  We now have an interactive terminal. We can check to see whether our module

works by typing in the following commands:

>>> from flitton_fib_py import say_hello
>>> say_hello()

Once the last command is typed, we will get the following printout in the terminal:

the Flitton Fibonacci module is saying hello

There we have it – our Python package works! This works for both private and public
GitHub repositories. Nothing is stopping us now from packaging private Python code
to reuse on other private Python projects!

While this is a useful tool to package and install code on other computers with
minimal setup, we have to be careful. When we are running the setup.py file, we
are running the code as our root user. Therefore, we have to ensure that we trust what
we are installing. Putting malicious code into the setup.py file is a vector of attack.
We can run direct commands on the computer using the SubProcess object from the
standard Python library. Make sure you trust the author of the code that you are installing
with pip install.

This also highlights how vigilant you have to be when merely just running pip
install. There are developers out there who will slightly change a package. For instance,
a famous case was the requests package. This is a common, well-used package;
however, for some time, there was an imitation package called request. They relied on
people mistyping pip install and downloading the wrong package. This is known as
typosquatting.

We have now packaged our Python code into a module. However, it is not a very
useful module. This brings us to our next section, where we package our Fibonacci
sequencing code.

Packaging Python code in a pip module
Now that we have our GitHub repository configured, we can start building out our
Fibonacci code for our module. To achieve this, we must carry out the following steps:

1.  Build our Fibonacci calculation code.

2.  Create a command-line interface.

3.  Test our Fibonacci calculation code with unit tests.

Let's now discuss each of these steps in detail.

114     Building pip Modules in Python

Building our Fibonacci calculation code
When it comes to building our Fibonacci calculation code, we will have two
functions – one that will calculate a Fibonacci number and another that will take a list
of numbers and lean on the calculation function to return a list of calculated Fibonacci
numbers. For this module, we will take a functional programming approach. This does
not mean that we should have a functional programming approach every time we build
a pip module. We are using functional programming because Fibonacci sequence
calculations naturally flow well with a functional programming style.

Python is an object-orientated language, and problems that have multiple moving parts
interrelating naturally flow well with object-orientated approaches. Our module structure
will take the following form:

├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── flitton_fib_py
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── fib_calcs
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── fib_number.py
│       └── fib_numbers.py
├── setup.py

For this chapter, we will maintain a simple interface so that we can focus on the packaging
of code in a pip module. Here are the steps:

1.  First, we can build our Fibonacci number calculator in the fib_number.py file

with the following code:

from typing import Optional

def recurring_fibonacci_number(number: int) -> \
Optional[int]:
    if number < 0:
        return None
    elif number <= 1:
        return number
    else:
    return recurring_fibonacci_number(number - 1) + \
           recurring_fibonacci_number(number - 2)

Packaging Python code in a pip module     115

Here, it has to be noted that we are returning None when the input number is
below zero. Technically, we should be throwing an error, but this is in place, for
now, to demonstrate the effectiveness of a checking tool later on in our Configuring
continuous integration section. As we know from the previous chapter, the preceding
code will correctly calculate a Fibonacci number based on the input number.

2.  Now that we have this function, we can depend on this to create a function

that creates a list of Fibonacci numbers in our fib_numbers.py file with the
following code:

from typing import List
from .fib_number import recurring_fibonacci_number

def calculate_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return [recurring_fibonacci_number(number=i) \
      for i in numbers]

We are now ready to test our pip module again. We must push our code to the
main branch on our repository again, uninstall our pip package in another virtual
environment, and install again using pip install.

3.

In our Python terminal with our new installed package, we can test our
recurring_fibonacci_number function with the following console
commands:

>>> from flitton_fib_py.fib_calcs.fib_number
    import recurring_fibonacci_number
>>> recurring_fibonacci_number(5)
5
>>> recurring_fibonacci_number(8)
21

Here, we can see that our Fibonacci function can be imported, and it works,
calculating the correct Fibonacci numbers.

4.  We can test our calculate_numbers with the following commands:

>>> from flitton_fib_py.fib_calcs.fib_numbers
     import calculate_numbers
>>> calculate_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]

116     Building pip Modules in Python

Here, we can see that our calculate_numbers function also works. We have a fully
functioning Fibonacci pip module. However, if we want to just calculate a Fibonacci
number without coding a Python script, we should not have to go into a Python terminal.
We can remedy this by building a command-line interface in the next step.

Creating a command-line interface
In order to build our command line function, our module can take the following
structure:

├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── flitton_fib_py
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── cmd
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── fib_numb.py
│   └── fib_calcs
     . . .

To build our interface, we follow these steps:

1.  We build the command-line interface in our fib_numb.py file with the

following code:

import argparse
from flitton_fib_py.fib_calcs.fib_number \
    import recurring_fibonacci_number

def fib_numb() -> None:
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        description='Calculate Fibonacci numbers')
    parser.add_argument('--number', action='store',
                        type=int, required=True,
                        help="Fibonacci number to be \
                          calculated")
    args = parser.parse_args()
    print(f"Your Fibonacci number is: " \

Packaging Python code in a pip module     117

      f"{recurring_fibonacci_number \
        (number=args.number)}")

Here, we can see that we get the parameters passed in from the command line
using the argparse module. Once we have obtained the parameters, we will
then calculate the number and print it out. Now, for us to actually access it via the
terminal, we have to point to it in the setup.py file at the root of the pip package
by adding the following parameter in the setup object initialization:

entry_points={
    'console_scripts': [
        'fib-number = \
           flitton_fib_py.cmd.fib_numb:fib_numb',
    ],
},

Here, what we are doing is linking the fib-number console command with the
function that we have just defined. After uninstalling our pip module in another
virtual environment, uploading the changes to the main branch on our repository,
and installing our new module using pip install, we will have our new module
with the command-line tool that we have built.

2.  Once it is installed, we just type in the following command:

fib-number

We get the following output:

usage: fib-number [-h] --number NUMBER
fib-number: error: the following arguments are
required: --number

Here, we can see that the argparse module that we are using ensures that we
provide the arguments needed. If we need help, we can get this by typing in the
following command:
fib-number -h

This gives us the help printout, as shown here:

usage: fib-number [-h] --number NUMBER

Calculate Fibonacci numbers

optional arguments:

118     Building pip Modules in Python

  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --number NUMBER  Fibonacci number to be calculated

We can see that we have the type and the help description of what it does.

3.  So, to calculate the Fibonacci number, we use the following command:

fib-number --number 20

This gives us the following printout:

Your Fibonacci number is: 6765

If we were to provide a string instead of a number for our argument, our program
would refuse it, throwing an error.

Here we have it, we have a fully working command-line tool! This does not stop here.
You can take this further. Nothing is stopping you from using subprocess from
the standard library combined with other libraries, such as Docker, to build your own
DevOps tools. You can automate whole workflows for yourself and the applications you
make. However, if we are to rely more and more on our pip modules to do the repetitive
heavy lifting, we can get into serious problems if the program introduces some bugs we
need to know straight away. To do this, we need to start building unit tests for our module.
These are covered in the next subsection.

Building unit tests
Unit tests are helpful for us to check and maintain quality control for our code. To build
our unit tests, our module will have the following structure:

├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── flitton_fib_py
     . . .
├── scripts
│   └── run_tests.sh
├── setup.py
├── tests
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── flitton_fib_py
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── fib_calcs
│           ├── __init__.py

Packaging Python code in a pip module     119

│           ├── test_fib_number.py
│           └── test_fib_numbers.py

We can see that we are mimicking the structure of the code in our module. This is
important to keep track of our tests. If the module grows, then we will not get lost in
our tests. If we need to chop out a directory or move it to another module, we can simply
delete the appropriate directory or move it. It also has to be noted that we have built a
Bash script to run our tests.

When it comes to writing our tests, it is usually best to code based on the chain of
dependency. For instance, our files have the dependency chain depicted as follows:

Figure 4.4 – Dependency chain

Considering our dependency chain, we should ideally write our tests for the fib_
number.py file first and make sure that our recurring_fibonacci_number
function works before writing tests that rely on the recurring_fibonacci_number
function. Here are the steps to write our tests:

1.  We first import what we need to test our code in our test_fib_number.py file

via the following code:

from unittest import main, TestCase

from flitton_fib_py.fib_calcs.fib_number \
    import recurring_fibonacci_number

The main function is to run all tests. We also rely on the TestCase class by
writing our own test class that inherits TestCase. This gives our class extra class
functions to aid us in testing outcomes.

120     Building pip Modules in Python

2.  We can write our own tests for a range of inputs with the following code:

class RecurringFibNumberTest(TestCase):

    def test_zero(self):
        self.assertEqual(0,
            recurring_fibonacci_number(number=0)
        )
    def test_negative(self):
        self.assertEqual(
            None, recurring_fibonacci_number \
              (number=-1)
        )
    def test_one(self):
        self.assertEqual(1, \
          recurring_fibonacci_number(number=1))
    def test_two(self):
        self.assertEqual(1, \
          recurring_fibonacci_number(number=2))
    def test_twenty(self):
        self.assertEqual( \
        6765, recurring_fibonacci_number(number=20)
        )

Here, it has to be noted that each one of our functions has the test_ prefix. This
flags the function as a test function. This is also the case for the name of the file. All
test files have the test_ prefix to flag that the file houses tests. In our testing code,
we can see that we have merely passed a range of inputs into the function that we
are testing and asserted that the outcome is what we expect. If the assertions do not
hold water, then we get an error and a failed result. Seeing as we are just testing the
same function repeatedly, we can put all of the assertions into one test function.
This is usually preferred if we are testing the whole object. We would essentially
have one test function for each function that we are testing in the object.

Packaging Python code in a pip module     121

3.  Now that all our tests have been run, we can run the unittest main function if
the test_fib_number.py file is run directly at the bottom of the test_fib_
number.py file with the code shown next:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

4.  We now have to set our PYTHONPATH variable to the directory of flitton_

fib_py.

Once this is done, we can run our test_fib_number.py file and get the console
printout as shown:

.....
--------------------------------------------------
Ran 5 tests in 0.002s

OK

We can see that each test function is a test. The dots at the top are each test. If we
were to change the None to a 1 in the second test, we would get the following
printout:
F....
====================================================
FAIL: test_negative (tests.flitton_fib_py.fib_calcs.
test_fib_number.RecurringFibNumberTest)
----------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):

  test_fib_number.py", line 15, in test_negative
    self.assertEqual(
AssertionError: 1 != None
---------------------------------------------------
Ran 5 tests in 0.003s

We can see that we now have an F in the test dots, and it highlights what test is
failing and where it is failing.

122     Building pip Modules in Python

5.  Now that we have built our base test, we can build our tests for the function
that takes in a list of integers and returns a list of Fibonacci numbers. In our
test_fib_numbers.py file, we import what we need with the following code:

from unittest import main, TestCase
from unittest.mock import patch

from flitton_fib_py.fib_calcs.fib_numbers \
    import calculate_numbers

Here, we can see that we are importing the function that we are testing and the same
main and TestCase. However, it has to be noted that we have imported a patch
function. This is because we have already tested our recurring_fibonacci_
number function. The patch function enables us to insert a MagicMock object in
place of our recurring_fibonacci_number function.

For our example, it can be argued that we do not need to patch anything. However, it is
important to get an understanding of patching. Patching enables us to bypass expensive
processes. For instance, if we are relying on a function that must make an API call, we
should not have to make those API calls when testing. Instead, we can just patch the
function. This also isolates the test. If a particular test is failing, we know that is something
to do with the code that we are testing directly and not external code that it is depending
on. It also speeds up the testing as we are not fully running code that we are depending
on multiple times in different tests. We also get granularity because we use a MagicMock
object; we can define the return values to anything we want during the test and log all calls
to the MagicMock object.

The advantage here is that we might accidentally call the function we are depending on
twice for some reason. However, if the function returns the same value twice, we will not
know anything if we did not patch it. However, with patching, we can inspect the calls and
throw errors if the behavior is not what we expect. We can also test a range of edge cases
very quickly by merely changing the return value of the patches and rerunning the test.

Packaging Python code in a pip module     123

With all this, it is understandable that we can get excited about patching. However, there
are some downsides. If we do not update the patches' return values, the dependent code
does not get the changes, and the testing does not remain accurate. This is why it is always
sensible to have a mixture of approaches and run a functional test that runs the whole
process without patching anything. With all this in mind, our patched unit test in the
tests/flitton_fib_by/fib_calcs/test_fib_numbers.py file is carried out
by the following code:

class Test(TestCase):

    @patch("flitton_fib_py.fib_calcs.fib_numbers."
           "recurring_fibonacci_number")
    def test_calculate_numbers(self, mock_fib_calc):
        expected_outcome = [mock_fib_calc.return_value,
                          mock_fib_calc.return_value]
        self.assertEqual(expected_outcome,
                         calculate_numbers(numbers=[3, 4]))

        self.assertEqual(2,
          len(mock_fib_calc.call_args_list))
        self.assertEqual({'number': 3},
          mock_fib_calc.call_args_list[0][1])
        self.assertEqual({'number': 4},
          mock_fib_calc.call_args_list[1][1])

Here, we can see that we have used the patch as a decorator with a string that defines the
path to the function that we are patching. We then pass the patched function through the
test function under the mock_fib_calc parameter. We then state that we expect the
outcome of the function that we are directly testing (calculate_numbers) to be a list
of two return values of the patched function. We then pass two integers wrapped in a list
into the calculate_numbers function and assert that this is going to be the same as
our expected outcome. Once this is done, we assert that the mock_fib_calc was only
called twice, and we inspect each of those calls, asserting that they are the numbers that
we passed in, in the correct order. This has given us a lot of power to truly inspect our
code. However, we are not done yet; we also must define the functional test to enable us to
run our tests with the code here:

    def test_functional(self):
        self.assertEqual([2, 3, 5],

124     Building pip Modules in Python

            calculate_numbers(numbers=[3, 4, 5]))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

For our module, all our unit tests are done. However, we do not want to go through
manually running each file to see our tests. There will be times where we want to just
see all the outcomes of the tests to see if there are any fails. To automate this, we can
build a Bash script in the run_tests.sh file with the code here:

#!/usr/bin/env bash

SCRIPTPATH="$( cd "$(dirname "$0")" ; pwd -P )"
cd $SCRIPTPATH
cd ..

source venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH="./flitton_fib_py"

python -m unittest discover

Here, we claim that the file is a Bash script with the first line. The first line is a shebang
line and tells the computer running it what type of language it is. We then get the
directory path of where this script is and assign it to the SCRIPTPATH variable. We
then navigate to this directory, move out to the root of our module, activate our virtual
environment, and then define our PYTHONPATH variable to be in our module with
the Fibonacci number code. Now that everything is defined, to run our test we use the
unittest command-line tool to run all the unit tests. Remember, all our tests have the
test_ prefix in their filenames. Running this gives us the following printout:

.......
------------------------------------------
Ran 7 tests in 0.003s

OK

Configuring continuous integration     125

Here, we can see that we have seven tests running and they have all passed. We can see
that we have started automating the test-running process. This is not where we should
stop. As we move forward onto packaging and distributing our pip module, we should
investigate automating the processes through continuous integration, which is what we
explore in the next section. Right now, as it stands, if a user has access to our GitHub
repository, we can install the code via pip and use it.

Configuring continuous integration
Our Python pip package is fully functioning. However, this is not the end. We will need
to maintain the quality of the code and enable it to be constantly upgraded when we push
new features to our module and refactor existing code. Continuous integration enables us
to ensure that the tests pass and that the standard of quality is maintained. It also speeds
up the deployment process, enabling us to push new iterations within a matter of minutes,
enabling us to focus on the task at hand. It also reduces the risk of making a mistake.

As we know, the most mundane, repetitive tasks are the ones that are at the highest risk
of a mistake occurring. This is just a fact of life. It's known that most car crashes happen
within 5 minutes of the driver's home. This is because the drivers pay less attention and
their brain switches off, relying on muscle memory. Deployment processes are the same.
They are repetitive and do not require a lot of mental focus. As a result, after several times,
we will start to rely on muscle memory and forget to check certain things, and make
minor blunders when deploying our pip package. Continuous integration
is a must to avoid mistakes and saves time in not only deployment but also in not having
to correct the errors. To set up continuous integration, we are going to have to carry out
the following steps:

1.  Manually deploy onto PyPI.

2.  Manage our dependencies.

3.  Set up type checking for Python.

4.  Set up and run tests and type checking with GitHub Actions.
5.  Create automatic versioning for our pip package.

6.  Deploy onto PyPI using GitHub Actions.

Let's have a look at each of these steps in detail in the following subsections.

126     Building pip Modules in Python

Manually deploying onto PyPI
We now move on to our first step of manually deploying our GitHub repository onto
PyPI. We have installed our pip package by directly pointing to the GitHub repository.
However, if we are allowing everyone to access our module as it's open source, it is
easier to upload our package onto PyPI. This will enable others to install using a simple
command. Here are the steps:

1.  First, we need to package our pip module before we upload it. This can be done

with the following command:

python setup.py sdist

What this does is package our pip module in a tar.gz file, which gives us the
following file outline:
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── dist
│   └── flitton_fib_py-0.0.1.tar.gz
├── flitton_fib_py
    . . .

2.  We can now see that the version is included in the filename. We are now ready
to upload onto the PyPI server. To do this, we have to install twine with the
following command:

pip install twine

3.  We are now able to upload the tar.gz file with the following command:

twine upload dist/*

This uploads all of the packages that we have created. During this process, the
terminal will ask us for the PyPI username and password. It then uploads the
package and tells us where we can find out the module on PyPI. If we visit this,
we should get the view depicted in the following figure:

Configuring continuous integration     127

Figure 4.5 – PyPI view of our module

We can see that our README.md file is being directly rendered in the view in
Figure 4.5. We can now directly install this with the pip install command depicted
in the PyPI view. It must be noted that we now have a dependency. We need to manage
these dependencies. We will cover this in the next step.

Managing dependencies
When it comes to dependencies, we must manage two types. For instance, our twine
dependency helps us upload it onto PyPI. However, this is not needed for the pip
package. Therefore, we need two different lists of dependencies – one for development
and the other for actual use. We define the dependencies that we need for the
development with the simple standard command stated here:

pip freeze > requirements.txt

128     Building pip Modules in Python

What the pip freeze command gives us is a specific list of requirements that our
current Python environment needs to install in order to run. > requirements.txt
writes it to the requirements.txt file. If you are a new developer starting to develop
our module, you can install all the requirements needed with the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

We can be strict here because nothing is depending on the development requirements
apart from the direct development of our module. However, when it comes to our module,
we know that it will be installed into multiple systems with multiple requirements.
Therefore, we want to allow some flexibility. For instance, if our module was going to write
our Fibonacci numbers to yml and pickle files, then we will need to use the pyYAML
and dill modules to enable us to write our Fibonacci numbers to yml and pickle files.
To do this, we alter our install_requires parameter in our setup initialization in
the setup.py file with the code here:

install_requires=[
    "PyYAML>=4.1.2",
    "dill>=0.2.8"
],

It must be noted that these are not the latest packages. We must drop a few versions
and allow our dependency to be equal to or above that version. This gives our users
freedom when using our pip package in their systems. We also must copy and paste these
requirements into our requirements.txt file to ensure that our development is
consistent with the user experience of our pip module. Let's say that we are going to add
an optional feature which is to start a small Flask server that locally serves an API that
calculates Fibonacci numbers. Here, we can add an install_requires parameter in
our setup initialization in the setup.py file with the following code:

extras_require={
  'server': ["Flask>=1.0.0"]
},

Now, if we upload our new code to either PyPI or our personal GitHub repository, we
will have a different experience when installing our package. If we normally install it, we
will see that our pickle and yml requirements automatically install if we run the install
command, as shown here:

pip install flitton-fib-py[server]

Configuring continuous integration     129

It will actually install the server requirements. We can have as many requirements
for the server profile as we want, and they will all be installed. Remember, our
extras_require parameter is a dictionary, so we can define as many extra requirement
profiles as we want. With this, we now have development requirements, essential pip
module requirements, and optional pip module requirements. In the next step, we are
now going to rely on a new development requirement to check types.

Setting up type checking for Python
At this point in the book, we have experienced the safety that Rust introduces. When
types don't match up, the Rust compiler refuses to compile. However, with Python, we do
not get this, as Python is an interpreted language. However, we can mimic this using the
mypy module. The steps are as follows:

1.  First, we can install the mypy module with the following command:

pip install mypy

2.  We can then type-check by using the mypy entry point with the code here:

mypy flitton_fib_py

Here, we are pointing to the main code for our Python module. We should get the
console printout as follows:

flitton_fib_py/fib_calcs/fib_number.py:16:
error: Unsupported operand types for + ("int" and
"None")
flitton_fib_py/fib_calcs/fib_number.py:16:
error: Unsupported operand types for + ("None" and
"int")
flitton_fib_py/fib_calcs/fib_number.py:16:
error: Unsupported left operand type for + ("None")
flitton_fib_py/fib_calcs/fib_number.py:16:
note: Both left and right operands are unions
flitton_fib_py/fib_calcs/fib_numbers.py:13:
error: List comprehension has incompatible
type List[Optional[int]]; expected List[int]

130     Building pip Modules in Python

What mypy is doing is checking the consistency across all of our Python code!
Like a Rust compiler, it has found an inconsistency. However, because this is
Python, we can still run our Python code. While Python is memory-safe, the
strong type-checking that Rust enforces is going to reduce the risk of incorrect
variables being passed into the function in runtime. Now, we know that there is an
inconsistency. The inconsistency is that our recurring_fibonacci_number
function returns either None or int. However, our calculate_numbers
function relies on the recurring_fibonacci_number function for the return
value, but it returns a list of integers as opposed to returning a list of integers or
None values.

3.  We can constrict the return value to just an integer with the recurring_

fibonacci_number function:

def recurring_fibonacci_number(number: int) -> int:
    if number < 0:
        raise ValueError(
        "Fibonacci has to be equal or above zero"
        )
    elif number <= 1:
        return number
    else:
     return recurring_fibonacci_number(number - 1) + \
            recurring_fibonacci_number(number - 2)

Here, we can see that we raise an error if the input number is below zero. It's not
going to calculate anyway, so we might as well throw an error informing the user
that there is an error as opposed to silently producing a None value.

If we run our mypy check, we get the following console printout:
Success: no issues found in 6 source files

Here, we can see that all our files were checked and that they have type consistency.

However, we might forget to run this type of checking every time we upload new code
to the GitHub repository. In the next section, we will define GitHub Actions to automate
our checking.

Configuring continuous integration     131

Setting up and running tests and type-checking with
GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions run a series of computations that we can define in a yml file. We generally
use GitHub Actions to automate processes that need to run every time. Workflow yml
files are automatically detected by GitHub and run depending on what type of tags we give
it. We can set up our GitHub Actions by following these steps:

1.

 For our tests and type-checking tags, we will define these in the .github/
workflows/run-tests.yml file. In this file, we initially give a name for the
workflow, and state that it fires when there is a push from one branch to another.
This happens when a pull request is done as one branch is being pushed to another.
This also reruns if we push more changes to our branch before merging the pull
request. Our definitions are inserted at the top of the file with the following code:

name: Run tests
on: push

Here, we can see that the workflow is called Run tests.

2.  Next, we must define our jobs. We also must state that our job is a shell

command. We then define what the operating system is. Once we have done this,
we define the steps of the job. In our steps section, we then define the uses,
which we will state are actions with the following code:

jobs:
  run-shell-command:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

If we did not define the uses step, then we would not be able to access files such as
the requirements.

132     Building pip Modules in Python

3.  We are now ready to define the rest of the steps under the steps tag. These steps

usually have a name and run tag. For us, we will be defining three steps:

i.  The first one is to install the dependencies.

ii.  The second one is to run all the unit tests.

iii.  The third one is to run the type-checking with the code here:

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install –upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: run tests
        run: python -m unittest discover ./tests
      - name: run type checking
        run: mypy flitton_fib_py

It must be noted that run is just a one-line terminal command. At one point, there
is a | (pipe) value next to a run tag of the Install dependencies step. This
pipe value simply allows us to write multiple lines of commands in one step. We
must ensure that our requirements.txt file is updated with the mypy module.
Once this is done, we can push this code to our GitHub repository and this GitHub
action will run when we do pull requests. If you are familiar with GitHub and
making pull requests, then you can move on to the next step. However, if you are
not, then we can perform one now.

4.  First, we have to pull a new branch from our main branch with the following

command:

git checkout -b test

With this, we then have a branch called test. We can then make a change in
our code.

5.  To just trigger a GitHub action with a pull request, we can simply scar our code

with a comment in any file, such as the one here:

# trigger build (14-6-2021)

You can write whatever, as it is just a comment if the code has changed. We then
add and commit our changes to our test branch and push it to the GitHub
repository. Once this is done, we can trigger a pull request by clicking on the
Pull requests tab and selecting our test branch, as shown here:

Configuring continuous integration     133

Figure 4.6 – Setting up a GitHub pull request

6.  Once this is done, we can click on Create pull request to view it. Here, we will
see all the GitHub Actions that get triggered and their status, as shown in the
following figure:

Figure 4.7 – View of the GitHub Actions status of pull requests

134     Building pip Modules in Python

We can see that our tests have failed! If we click on Details, we can see that
everything is working; it is just that we forgot to update our tests. If we remember,
we changed our code to throw an error if we pass in a negative value into the
Fibonacci calculation function, as shown next:

Figure 4.8 – View of the GitHub Actions execution details

7.  We can change the test code to assert that an error is raised by the testing code in

the tests/flitton_fib_py/fib_calcs/test_fib_number.py file with
the following code:

def test_negative(self):
    with self.assertRaises(ValueError) as \
raised_error:
        recurring_fibonacci_number(number=-1)
    self.assertEqual(
        "Fibonacci has to be equal or above zero",
        str(raised_error.exception)
    )

Here, we can see that we assert that a value error is raised because we are running
code that we expect to raise an error, and that the exception is what we expect of it.
Pushing this to our GitHub repository will ensure that all the tests have passed. We
can merge the pull request if we want the code to be merged into our main branch.

Configuring continuous integration     135

We have seen from this example that continuous integration is useful. It has
picked up a change in the code that we might not have noted if we were doing
everything manually.

Now that our tests run automatically, we need to automate keeping track of the version
of our module to avoid making the same mistake we made with not updating our tests.

Create automatic versioning for our pip package
To automate the process of updating the version number, we are going to put several
functions in the get_latest_version.py file in the root of our pip module.
Following are the steps:

1.  First, we need to import everything we need with the following code:

import os
import pathlib
from typing import Tuple, List, Union
import requests

We are going to use os and pathlib to manage writing the latest version to a file.
We are also going to use the requests module to call PyPI to get the latest version
that is currently available to the public.

2.  To do this, we can create a function that will get the metadata of our module from

PyPI and return the version with the following code:

def get_latest_version_number() -> str:
    req = requests.get(
    "https://pypi.org/pypi/flitton-fib-py/json")
    return req.json()["info"]["version"]

3.  This is just a simple web request. Once we have done this, we are going to want to

unpack this string into a tuple of integers with the function defined next:

def unpack_version_number(version_string: str) \
    -> Tuple[int, int, int]:
    version_buffer: List[str] = \
      version_string.split(".")
    return int(version_buffer[0]),\
      int(version_buffer[1]),int(version_buffer[2])

136     Building pip Modules in Python

Here, we can see that this is a simple split via bullet points. We then convert them to
integers and pack them into a tuple to be returned.

4.  Now that we have got our version number, we need to increase this by one with the

function defined next:

def increase_version_number(version_buffer: \
Union[Tuple[int, int, int], List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    first: int = version_buffer[0]
    second: int = version_buffer[1]
    third: int = version_buffer[2]

    third += 1
    if third >= 10:
        third = 0
        second += 1
        if second >= 10:
            second = 0
            first += 1

    return [first, second, third]

Here, we can see that if one of the integers is equal or greater than 10, we set it back
to 0 and increase the next number by 1. The only one that does not get sent to 0 is
the furthest number to the left. This will just keep going up.

5.  Now that we have increased our number by 1, we will need to pack the integer into

a string, with the function defined next:

def pack_version_number(
    version_buffer: Union[Tuple[int, int, int],
      List[int]]) -> str:
    return f"{version_buffer[0]}.{version_buffer[1]} \
      .{version_buffer[2]}"

6.  Once we have packed this into a string, we will have to write the version to a file.

This can be done with the function defined next:

def write_version_to_file(version_number: str) -> \
None:
    version_file_path: str = str( \

Configuring continuous integration     137

    pathlib.Path(__file__).parent.absolute()) + \
    "/flitton_fib_py/version.py"

    if os.path.exists(version_file_path):
        os.remove(version_file_path)

    with open(version_file_path, "w") as f:
        f.write(f"VERSION='{version_number}'")

Here, we can see that we ensure that the path is going to be at the root of our
module. We then delete the version file if it already exists, as it will already be
out of date.

7.  We then write our updated version number to the file with the following code:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    write_version_to_file(
        version_number=pack_version_number(
            version_buffer=increase_version_number(
                version_buffer=unpack_version_number(
            version_string=get_latest_version_number()
                )
            )
        )
    )

This ensures that if we run the file directly, we will get the updated version written
to a file.

8.  Now, in our setup.py file at the root of our module, we must read the version file
and define it for our version parameter in the setup initialization. For that, we first
import pathlib into our file and read the version file with this code:

import pathlib

with open(str(pathlib.Path(__file__).parent.absolute()) +
          "/flitton_fib_py/version.py", "r") as fh:
    version = fh.read().split("=")[1].replace("'", "")

138     Building pip Modules in Python

9.  We then set the version parameter with the read value with the following code:

setup(
    name="flitton_fib_py",
    version=version,
    ...

We now have our version update process fully automated; we must plug this into our
GitHub Actions, so we automatically run the update process and push to PyPI when
merging with our main branch.

Deploying onto PyPI using GitHub Actions
To enable our GitHub actions to push to PyPI, we need to follow these steps:

1.  First, we store the username and password for our PyPI account in the Secrets

section of our GitHub repository. This can be done by clicking on the Settings tab
and then the Secrets tab on the left sidebar, as shown here:

Figure 4.9 – View of the GitHub Secrets section

2.  On the top right of the view in Figure 4.9 is New repository secret. If we click this,

we will get the following screen:

Configuring continuous integration     139

Figure 4.10 – View of the GitHub secret creation section

Here, we can create a secret for our PyPI password and another secret for our
PyPI username.

Now that we have our secrets defined, we can build our GitHub action in the .github/
workflows/publish-package.yml file:

1.  First, we need to ensure that we publish our package only when we have merged
a branch with the main branch. To do this, we need to ensure that our action
only executes when there's a pull request when it's closed, and the branch being
pointed out is main with the following code:

name: Publish Python         distributions             to PyPI

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]
    branches:
      - main

140     Building pip Modules in Python

2.  Once this is done, we can define the basic jobs of installing the dependencies and

updating the package version with jobs, defined in the following code:

jobs:
  run-shell-command:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: update version
        run: python get_latest_version.py

What we have done is fine so far. However, it will run when any pull request
pointing to main is closed. Therefore, we must ensure that the pull request has
merged before executing the step.

3.  For the next section, we install the dependencies with the following code:

      - name: install deployment dependancies
        if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true
        run: |
          pip install twine
          pip install pexpect

4.  We can see that our conditional statements are straightforward. We then run the

setup.py file for it to produce our distribution with the following step:

      - name: package module
        if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true
        run: python setup.py sdist

5.  Now that we have defined all the steps needed to prepare our package, we can

upload our package using twine with the following code:

      - name: deploy to pypi
        if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true
        env:
          TWINE_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.TWINE_USERNAME

Summary     141

            }}
          TWINE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.TWINE_PASSWORD
            }}
        run: |
          twine upload dist/*

Here, we can see that we have automated the deployment of our module to PyPI using
GitHub Actions.

Summary
In this chapter, we have managed to build a fully fledged pip Python module that has
continuous integration. We initially set up a GitHub repository and created a virtual
environment. This is an essential skill for most Python projects, and you should be using
GitHub repositories and virtual environments even if your project is not a pip module.
You will be able to share your project and work with other team members. We then
defined our setup.py file so our code could be installed via pip. Even if our GitHub
repository is private, people who have access to the GitHub repository could freely install
our code. This gives us even more power when it comes to distributing our code.

When we have an interface defined, our users do not need to know much about our code,
just how to use the interface. This also enables us to prevent repeated code. For instance, if
we build a user data model with a database driver, we can package it as a pip module and
use this in multiple web applications. All we need to do is change the data model in the
pip module and make a new release, and then all web applications can use the updated
version if they wish.

Once our code was packaged, we rebuilt our Fibonacci code in our pip module, and it
worked. We then went further, building entry points that enabled us to define our own
command-line tools. This makes our code packaging even more powerful, as the user
doesn't even have to import and code the module; they can just call the command-line
argument! With this, we can build development tools to speed up our development by
automating tasks with these entry points. We then built basic unit tests to ensure that
the quality of our code was maintained. We then locked in these good standards with
automation pipelines using GitHub Actions. We introduced type-checking with mypy
alongside our unit-testing pipeline. We don't have to stop here. For instance, the Python
script that we coded that increased the version number by one could be built in its own
pip repository with a command-line interface. With this, we could install the module
using pip install in our GitHub Actions and run the commands. Now, with this code
packaging, you can build your own tools and add them to your belt, reducing the amount
of repetition in your daily coding as time goes on.

142     Building pip Modules in Python

In the next chapter, we cover what we have done in this chapter in Rust. Considering this,
we harness the safety and speed of Rust, with the flexibility of pip packaging. Utilizing
this will level up your skills as a Python toolmaker, making you invaluable to your team.

Questions

1.  How would you perform an installation with pip install of our GitHub

repository on the test branch?

2.  Can other developers who do not have access to your GitHub repository install your

pip package if you upload it to PyPI?

3.  What is the difference between development dependencies and package

dependencies?

4.  mypy ensures the consistency of types when it comes to our Python code. How is

this different from type-checking in Rust?

5.  Why should we automate boring repetitive tasks?

Answers

1.  pip install git+https://github.com/maxwellflitton/flitton-

fib-py@test

2.  Yes, they can download it despite not having access to your GitHub repository. If
we think about it, we package our pip module in a file and then upload it to the
PyPI server. Downloading our package from the PyPI server is not connected to our
GitHub repository.

3.  Development dependencies are specific dependencies defined in the

requirements.txt file. This ensures that developers can work on the pip
package. Package requirements are a little more relaxed and defined in the setup.
py file. These get installed when the user installs our package. Package requirements
are to enable the pip package to be used.

4.  Rust does the type-checking when it is compiling and fails to compile if the

types are inconsistent. Because of this, we cannot run it. Python, however, is an
interpreted language. Because of this, we can still run it with the potential errors.

5.  Repetitive tasks are easy to automate, so the effort invested is not excessive. Also,
repetitive tasks have a higher risk of producing errors. Automating these tasks
reduces the number of errors we could make.

Creating a
Rust Interface for
Our pip Module

In Chapter 4, Building pip Modules in Python, we built a pip module in Python. Now, we
will build the same pip module in Rust and manage the interface. Some people might
prefer Python for some tasks; others will state that Rust is better. In this chapter, we will
simply utilize both as and when we want. To achieve this, we will build a pip module
in Rust that can be installed and directly imported into our Python code. We will also
build Python entry points that talk directly to our compiled Rust code, and Python
adapters/interfaces to make the user experience of our module easy, safe, and locked
down with user interfaces (UIs) that have all features that we want our user to use.

146     Creating a Rust Interface for Our pip Module

In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

•  Packaging Rust with pip

•  Building a Rust interface with the pyO3 crate

•  Building tests for our Rust package

•  Comparing speed with Python, Rust, and Numba

Covering these topics will enable us to build Rust modules and use them in our Python
systems. This is a major advantage as a Python developer; you can use faster, safer, and less
resource-intensive code seamlessly in your Python programs.

Technical requirements
We will need to have Python 3 installed. To get the most out of this chapter, we will also
need to have a GitHub account, as we will be using GitHub to package our code, which
can be accessed via this link: https://github.com/maxwellflitton/flitton-
fib-rs.

The code for this chapter can be found at https://github.com/
PacktPublishing/Speed-up-your-Python-with-Rust/tree/main/
chapter_five.

Packaging Rust with pip
In this section, we will be setting up our pip package so that it can utilize Rust code. This
will enable us to use Python setup tools to import our Rust pip package, compile it for
our system, and use it within our Python code. For this chapter, we are essentially building
the same Fibonacci module that we built in Chapter 4, Building pip Modules in Python. It
is advised to create another GitHub repository for our Rust module; however, nothing is
stopping you from refactoring your existing Python pip module. To build our Rust pip
module, we are going to have to carry out the following steps:

1.  Define gitignore and Cargo for our package.

2.  Configure a Python setup process for our package.

3.  Create a Rust library for our package.

Packaging Rust with pip     147

Define gitignore and Cargo for our package
To get started, we must make sure that our Git does not track files that we do not want to
upload and that our Cargo has the right dependencies with step 1.

1.  First, we can start with gitignore. If you are choosing to use the same GitHub
repository as the one that we defined in the previous chapter, then all the files for
Python are already defined in the .gitignore file at the root of the GitHub
repository. If not, then when you are creating your new GitHub repository, we have
to select the Python template in the Add .gitignore section. Either way, once
we have the Python gitignore template in our .gitignore file, we must add
our gitignore requirements for the Rust part of our package. To do this, we add
the following code in the .gitignore file:

 /target/

Yes, that is it for our Rust code. That is a lot less than the Python files that we need
to ignore.

2.  Now that we have defined gitignore, we can move on to defining our Cargo.

toml file in the root of our package, initially defining the metadata of our package
with the following code:

[package]
name = "flitton_fib_rs"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Maxwell Flitton
  <maxwellflitton@gmail.com>"]
edition = "2018"

This is nothing new; all we are doing here is defining the name and generic
information of our package.

3.  We then go on to define the dependencies with the following code:

[dependencies]

[dependencies.pyo3]
version = "0.13.2"
features = ["extension-module"]

148     Creating a Rust Interface for Our pip Module

We can see that we have not defined any dependencies in the dependencies
section. We will be depending on the pyo3 crate to enable our Rust code to interact
with our Python code. We declare the latest version of the crate at the point of
writing this book, and the fact that we want to enable the extension-module
feature because we will be using pyo3 to make our Rust module.

4.  We then define our library data with the following code:

[lib]
name = "flitton_fib_rs"
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

It must be noted that we have defined a crate-type variable. Crate types provide
information to the compiler on how to link Rust crates together. This can either
be static or dynamic. For instance, if we were to define the crate-type variable
as bin, this would compile our Rust code as a runnable executable. The main file
would have to be present in our module, as this would be the entry point. We could
also define the crate-type variable as lib, which compiles it as a library that
can be used by other Rust programs. We can go further with this, defining either a
static or dynamic library. Defining the crate-type variable as cdylib tells the
compiler that we want a dynamic system library to be loaded by another language.
If we do not put this in, we will not be able to compile our code when installing
our library via pip. Our library should be able to compile for Linux and Windows.
However, we require some link arguments to ensure that our library also works on
macOS.
In order to do this, we need to define the configuration in the .cargo/config
file:

5.

[target.x86_64-apple-darwin]
rustflags = [
    "-C", "link-arg=-undefined",
    "-C", "link-arg=dynamic_lookup",
]
[target.aarch64-apple-darwin]
rustflags = [
    "-C", "link-arg=-undefined",
    "-C", "link-arg=dynamic_lookup",
]

Packaging Rust with pip     149

With this, we have defined all that we need for our Rust library. Now, we move on to the
next step, configuring the Python part of our module.

Configuring the Python setup process for our package
When it comes to setting up the Python section, we will be defining this in the setup.py
file at the root of our module. Initially, we are going to import all the requirements that we
need with the following code:

#!/usr/bin/env python
from setuptools import dist
dist.Distribution().fetch_build_eggs(['setuptools_rust'])
from setuptools import setup
from setuptools_rust import Binding, RustExtension

We are going to use the setuptools_rust module for managing our Rust code.
However, we cannot be sure that the user will have installed setuptools_rust and we
need it for running our setup code. Because of this, we cannot rely on the requirements
list, as installing the requirements happens after we have imported setuptools_rust.
To get around this, we use the dist module to get the required setuptools_rust
module for this script. The user does not permanently install setuptools_rust but
uses it for the script. Now that this is done, we can define our setup with the following
code:

setup(
    name="flitton-fib-rs",
    version="0.1",
    rust_extensions=[RustExtension(
        ".flitton_fib_rs.flitton_fib_rs",
        path="Cargo.toml", binding=Binding.PyO3)],
    packages=["flitton_fib_rs"],
    classifiers=[
            "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
            "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha",
            "Intended Audience :: Developers",
            "Programming Language :: Python",
            "Programming Language :: Rust",
            "Operating System :: POSIX",
            "Operating System :: MacOS :: MacOS X",

150     Creating a Rust Interface for Our pip Module

        ],
    zip_safe=False,
)

Here, we can see that we define the metadata of the module as we did in the previous
chapter. We can also see that we define a rust_extensions parameter, pointing to the
actual Rust module that we will define in a Rust file, as we can see in the following figure:

Figure 5.1 – Our module flow for setup

We also point to our Cargo.toml file, as we will have to compile other Rust crates that
are in our dependencies when we are installing our Rust module. We also must state that
our module is not zipped safely. This is also standard for C modules. Now that we have
done all the setup configurations, we can now move on to the next step of building our
basic Rust module that will get us installing Rust code using pip install that we can
use in our Python code:

1.  For our Rust code, we have to initially import all of the pyo3 requirements in the

src/lib.rs file with the following code:

use pyo3::prelude::*;
use pyo3::wrap_pyfunction;

What this does is enable our Rust code to utilize all the macros that the pyo3 crate
has. We will also be wrapping the Rust functions into the module.

Packaging Rust with pip     151

2.  We then define a basic hello world function with the following code:

#[pyfunction]
fn say_hello() {
    println!("saying hello from Rust!");
}

We can see that we have applied a Python function macro from pyo3 to the
say_hello function.

3.  Now that we have the function, we can define our module in the same file with the

following code:

#[pymodule]
fn flitton_fib_rs(_py: Python, m: &PyModule) -> \
  PyResult<()> {
    m.add_wrapped(wrap_pyfunction!(say_hello));
    Ok(())
}

Here, we can see that we have defined the module as flitton_fib_rs. This
will have to be imported as flitton_fib_rs when using it. We then use the
pymodule macro. This function is loading the module. We must define a result at
the end. Seeing as we do not have any complex logic, we will define the end result
as an Ok result. We don't need to do anything to Python; however, we add our
wrapped say_hello function to our module. The wrap_pyfunction macro
essentially takes a Python instance and returns a Python function. Now that we have
our Rust code defined, we must build our Python entry point.

4.  This is fairly simple; all we have to do is import our functions from the Rust module

in the flitton_fib_rs/__init__.py file with the following code:

from .flitton_fib_rs import *

We will go through how this works later in this chapter, as we will be installing this
package and running it.

Installing our Rust library for our package
Right now, we have everything we need to deploy our package and install it via pip.
Considering this, we upload our package to our GitHub repository, which is covered in
the Configuring setup tools for a Python pip module section of the Chapter 4, Building pip
Modules in Python.

152     Creating a Rust Interface for Our pip Module

Once we have done this, we can install our pip package with the following command,
all in one line:

pip install git+https://github.com/maxwellflitton/flitton-
  fib-rs@main

The URL to your GitHub repository might be different. When this is being installed, the
process will hang for a while. The result should give the following printout:

Collecting git+https://github.com/maxwellflitton
/flitton-fib-rs@main

Installing collected packages: flitton-fib-rs
  Running setup.py install for flitton-fib-rs ... done
Successfully installed flitton-fib-rs-0.1

This is because we are compiling the package based on our system. Here, we can see that
we collect the code from the main branch of the repository and run the setup.py file.
What we have essentially done is compile the Rust code into a binary file and put it next
to our __init__.py entry point file with the following file layout:

├── flitton_fib_rs
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── flitton_fib_rs.cpython-38-darwin.so

This is why our from .flitton_fib_rs import * code works in the entry point.

Now that this is all installed in our Python packages, we can run our Python console and
type in the following commands:

>>> from flitton_fib_rs import say_hello
>>> say_hello()
saying hello from Rust!

Building a Rust interface with the pyO3 crate     153

Here we have it! We have got Rust working with Python and we have managed to package
our Rust code as a pip module. This is a complete game changer. We can now utilize
Rust code without having to rewrite our Python systems. However, we only have one file
in Rust code. We need to learn how to build bigger Rust systems if we want to fully take
advantage of our ability to fuse Rust with Python.

Building a Rust interface with the pyO3 crate
Building an interface does not just mean adding more functions to our module in Rust
and wrapping them. In a sense, we do have to do some of this; however, exploring how
to import them from other Rust files is important. We also must explore and understand
the relationship that we can have between Rust and Python when we are building up our
module. To achieve this, we will carry out these steps:

1.  Build our Fibonacci module in our Rust package.

2.  Create command-line tools for our package.

3.  Create adapters for our package.

With step one, we can just build out our module with Rust code. Steps two and three are
more Python-focused, wrapping our Rust code in Python code to ease the interaction of
our Rust module with external Python code. In Chapter 6, Working with Python Objects in
Rust, we will interact directly with Python objects in our Rust code. With all this in mind,
let's our Python interface by initially building our Fibonacci code in Rust with step one.

Building our Fibonacci Rust code
In this step, we are going to build our Fibonacci module, spanning multiple Rust files. To
achieve this, the file structure of our module takes the following form:

├── Cargo.toml
├── README.md
├── flitton_fib_rs
│   ├── __init__.py
├── setup.py
├── src
│   ├── fib_calcs
│   │   ├── fib_number.rs
│   │   ├── fib_numbers.rs

154     Creating a Rust Interface for Our pip Module

│   │   └── mod.rs
│   ├── lib.rs

Here, we can see that we have added our Fibonacci code under the src/fib_calcs
directory, as we remember that fib_numbers.rs relies on fib_number.rs.

Now, let's follow these steps:

1.  We can initially define our Fibonacci number function in the fib_number.rs file

with the following code:

use pyo3::prelude::pyfunction;

#[pyfunction]
pub fn fibonacci_number(n: i32) -> u64 {
    if n < 0 {
         panic!("{} is negative!", n);
    }
     match n {
          0     => panic!("zero is not a right \
                   argument to fibonacci_number!"),
          1 | 2 => 1,
          _     => fibonacci_number(n - 1) +
                   fibonacci_number(n - 2)
    }
}

Here, we can see that we have imported the pyfunction macro to apply to our
function. By now, we are familiar with calculating a Fibonacci number; however,
unlike previous examples, it must be noted that we have removed the if the
input Fibonacci number to be calculated is 3 match statement.
This is because that match statement significantly speeds up the code, and we want
a fair speed comparison for the final section of this chapter.

2.  Now that we have defined our Fibonacci number function, we can define

our fibonacci_numbers function in the fib_numbers.rs file with the
following code:

use std::vec::Vec;
use pyo3::prelude::pyfunction;
use super::fib_number::fibonacci_number;

Building a Rust interface with the pyO3 crate     155

#[pyfunction]
pub fn fibonacci_numbers(numbers: Vec<i32>) -> \
  Vec<u64> {
    let mut vec: Vec<u64> = Vec::new();

    for n in numbers.iter() {
        vec.push(fibonacci_number(*n));
    }
    return vec
}

Here, we can see that we accepted a vector of integers, looped through them, and
appended them to an empty vector, returning the vector with all the calculated
Fibonacci numbers. Here, we have imported the fibonacci_number function.

3.  However, we remember that we will not be able to import it, and neither of these
functions will be available outside of the immediate directory if we do not define
them in the src/mod.rs file with the following code:

pub mod fib_number;
pub mod fib_numbers;

4.  Now that we have defined both of our functions and declared them in our

src/mod.rs file, we are now able to import them into our lib.rs file. We
do this by initially declaring the fib_calcs module, and then importing the
functions with the following code:

mod fib_calcs;

use fib_calcs::fib_number::__pyo3_get_function \
  _fibonacci_number;
use fib_calcs::fib_numbers::__pyo3_get_function \
  _fibonacci_numbers;
pub mod fib_numbers;

Here, it must be noted that our functions have the prefix of __pyo3_get_
function_. This enables us to retain the macros applied to the functions. If we
just directly import the functions, we will not be able to add them to the module,
which will result in compilation errors when we are installing our package.

156     Creating a Rust Interface for Our pip Module

5.  Now that our functions are imported and ready, we can import-wrap them and add

them to the module with the following code:

#[pymodule]
fn flitton_fib_rs(_py: Python, m: &PyModule) -> \
  PyResult<()> {
    m.add_wrapped(wrap_pyfunction!(say_hello));
    m.add_wrapped(wrap_pyfunction!(fibonacci_number));
    m.add_wrapped(wrap_pyfunction!(fibonacci_numbers);
    Ok(())
}

6.  Now that we have built our modules, we can test them. We do this by uploading
our changes to the GitHub repository, and using pip uninstall to uninstall
our pip module and pip install to install our new package. Once our new
package is installed, we can import and use our new functions in the Python
terminal as follows:

>>> from flitton_fib_rs import fibonacci_number,
fibonacci_numbers
>>> fibonacci_number(20)
6765
>>> fibonacci_numbers([20, 21, 22])
[6765, 10946, 17711]
>>>

Here, we can see that we can import and use the Fibonacci numbers that we have coded
in Rust that span multiple files! We are now at the stage where nothing is stopping us from
building our own Rust Python pip packages. If you have a specific problem in mind to
solve in Rust, such as an expensive computation that your Python program is struggling to
calculate, nothing is stopping you from solving that now.

Now that we have gone to the trouble of packaging our Python package written in Rust,
we can further utilize our package with command-line functionality. Packages installed
with pip are convenient, powerful tools for command-line functionality. In the next
section, we will access the Rust code in our package directly from the command line.

Building a Rust interface with the pyO3 crate     157

Creating command-line tools for our package
You may have noticed that to use our Fibonacci functions, we must start a Python console,
import the functions, and use them. This is not very efficient if we just want to calculate a
Fibonacci number in the console. We can remove these unnecessary procedures needed
for calculating a Fibonacci number in the terminal by defining our entry points.

Considering that we define our command-line entry points in the setup.py file, it
makes sense to define our entry point in a Python file that acts as a wrapper to our Rust
function (as we still want the speed benefits of Rust), as shown in the following figure:

Figure 5.2 – Flow for module entry point

This wrapper can be done by importing argparse and the fibonacci_number
function we made in the Rust module to create a simple Python function that gets user
input and then passes it into the Rust function, printing out the result. We can achieve this
by carrying out the following steps:

1.  We can build the Python function that collects the arguments and calls the Rust
code by adding the following code to the flitton_fib_rs/fib_number_
command.py file we create:

import argparse
from .flitton_fib_rs import fibonacci_number

def fib_number_command() -> None:
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        description='Calculate Fibonacci numbers')
    parser.add_argument('--number', action='store', \
      type=int, required=True,help="Fibonacci \

158     Creating a Rust Interface for Our pip Module

        number to becalculated")
    args = parser.parse_args()
    print(f"Your Fibonacci number is: "
          f"{fibonacci_number(n=args.number)}")
}

We must remember that when our Rust binary is compiled, it will be in the
flitton_fib_rs directory, right next to the file we just created.

2.  Next, we define the entry point in the setup.py file. Now that we have our

function, we can point to this in the setup.py file by declaring the path to this file
and function for the entry_points parameter with the following code:

entry_points={
    'console_scripts': [
        'fib-number = flitton_fib_rs.'
        'fib_number_command:'
        'fib_number_command',
    ],
},

3.  Once this is done, we have fully plumbed up the Python entry point in our package.
Finally, we can test our command line by passing in arguments to the entry point.
Now, if we update our GitHub repository and reinstall our package in the Python
environment, we can test our command line by typing in the following command:

fib-number --number 20

This will give us the following output:

Your Fibonacci number is: 6765

We can see that our command-line tools work. Now we are at the stage where we have
replicated the same functionality as our Python pip package previously in Chapter 4,
Building pip Modules in Python. However, we must go further now. We are fusing two
different languages in our package. To gain full command of our pip package, we need to
explore how to command and refine the interaction between Rust and Python.

In our next step, we will build adapters that enable us to do this.

Building a Rust interface with the pyO3 crate     159

Creating adapters for our package
Before we try and build adapter interfaces, we need to understand what an adapter is.
An adapter is a design pattern that manages the interface between two different modules,
applications, languages, and so on. The title of the design pattern is descriptive of what
we are doing. For instance, if you buy one of the new MacBook Pros, you will realize that
you only have USB-C ports. Instead of opening your MacBook and rewiring it so that it
can accept your standard USB memory stick, you buy an adapter. Adapters have multiple
advantages. When it comes to modular software engineering, this gives us an advantage.

For instance, let's say that module A relies on module B. Instead of importing aspects
of module B throughout module A, we can create adapters that manage the interface
between both modules. This, in turn, gives us a lot of flexibility. For instance, module C
could be built as an improvement on module B. Instead of working through module A
looking for, and trying to root out, the uses of module B, we know that they are all utilized
in the adapter. We can even produce a second adapter slowly moving over to module C
in time. If we want to delete a module or move it out, again, our connection to another
module can be severed instantly by just deleting the adapters. Adapters are simple and
give us ultimate flexibility.

Considering what we have discussed about adapters, it makes sense that we create
adapters between our Rust code and Python. Seeing as Python systems are essentially
using our Rust code, it makes sense to build our adapters in Python.

To demonstrate how to do this, we will create an adapter that accepts either a list or
an integer. It then selects the right Rust function and implements it. However, for our
purposes with this adapter, we can make up a scenario where there is a lot of incorrect
data being fed into the module. We do not want it to error every time incorrect data is
passed in, but we do want to categorize whether the calculation is a failure, and we want
to count the number of correct calculations we do. This seems specific, and we must
remember that, like the MacBook, we can have multiple adapters. Nothing is stopping us
from chopping, changing, and deleting in the future if we need to.

160     Creating a Rust Interface for Our pip Module

However, before we start writing code, we need to understand the layers involved for the
adapter, as described here:

Figure 5.3 – The layers of a Python adapter for a Rust module

In the preceding figure, we can see that Python objects come from types. However, we
can interject how these objects are called from types with metaclasses. When it comes
to metaclasses, we must build a metaclass that will define how our counter is called. Our
counter is going to be universal. We do not know how the users will use our interface.
They might loop through a list of data points, calling our adapter for each one. We need
to ensure that no matter how many adapters are being called, they are all pointing to the
same counter. This might be a little confusing. This will become clearer when we build it.

Using a singleton design pattern to build an adapter interface

First, we must define our Singleton metaclass:

1.  This can be done with the following code in the flitton_fib_rs/singleton.

py file we create:

class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:

Building a Rust interface with the pyO3 crate     161

            cls._instances[cls] = super(Singleton, \
              cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

2.  Here, we can see that our Singleton class inherits directly from type. Here, what
is happening is that we have a dictionary called _instances, where the keys to
this dictionary are the class types. When a class that has Singleton as a metaclass
is called, the type of that class is checked in the dictionary. If the type is not in the
dictionary, then it is constructed and put into the dictionary. The instance in the
dictionary is then returned. What this essentially means is that we cannot have two
instances of a class. This process is laid out in the following figure:

Figure 5.4 – The logic flow for a Singleton metaclass

162     Creating a Rust Interface for Our pip Module

3.  Now, we will use our Singleton class to construct our counter. This can be

done with the following code in the flitton_fib_rs/counter.py file that
we create:

from .singleton import Singleton

class Counter(metaclass=Singleton):

    def __init__(self, initial_value: int = 0) -> \
      None:
        self._value: int = initial_value

    def increase_count(self) -> None:
        self._value += 1

    @property
    def value(self) -> int:
        return self._value

Now, our Counter class cannot be constructed twice in the same program.
Therefore, we can ensure that there will only be one Counter class, no matter how
many times we call it.

4.  We can now use it on our main adapter. We will house our main adapter in the

flitton_fib_rs/fib_number_adapter.py file that we create. First of all,
we import all of the functions and objects that we need with the following code:

from typing import Union, List, Optional

from .flitton_fib_rs import fibonacci_number, \
    fibonacci_numbers
from .counter import Counter

Here, we can see that we have imported the typing that we need. We have also
imported the Rust Fibonacci numbers that we will be using and our counter. Now
that we have imported what we need, we can build our interface constructor.

Building a Rust interface with the pyO3 crate     163

5.  For our adapter, we will need to have a number input, a status of whether the

process is successful or not, along with the actual result, which will be the calculated
Fibonacci number, or an error message if there is a failure. We will also have a
counter, and we will have to process the input during the construction of the object.
This can be denoted with the following code:

class FlittonFibNumberAdapter:

    def __init__(self,
        number_input: Union[int, List[int]]) -> None:
        self.input: Union[int, List[int]] = \
          number_input
        self.success: bool = False
        self.result: Optional[Union[int, List[int]]] \
          = None
        self.error_message: Optional[str] = None
        self._counter: Counter = Counter()
        self._process_input()

Remember, even though we call the counter, it is a singleton pattern; therefore, the
counter will be the same instance across all instances of the adapter. Now that all of
the correct attributes have been defined, we have to define what is an actual success.

6.  This is where we state that success is True, and we increase the counter by one.
This can be denoted by the FlittonFibNumberAdapter instance function,
as shown here:

    def _define_success(self) -> None:
        self.success = True
        self._counter.increase_count()

This is smooth; because we have defined a clean interface for the counter, there is
little explanation needed. Now that we have our success defined, we need to process
the input because there are two different functions, one that takes a list and one that
takes an integer.

164     Creating a Rust Interface for Our pip Module

7.  We can pass in the correct input to the correct function with the

FlittonFibNumberAdapter instance function, as shown here:

    def _process_input(self) -> None:
        if isinstance(self.input, int):
            self.result = fibonacci_number( \
                n=self.input)
            self._define_success()

        elif isinstance(self.input, list):
            self.result = fibonacci_numbers( \
                numbers=self.input)
            self._define_success()
        else:
            self.error_message = "input needs to be \
              a list of ints or an int"

Here, we can see that we define an error message if there isn't a list of integers
passed in. If we do pass in the correct input, we define the result as the result of the
function and call the _define_success function.

8.  The only thing left is to expose the count for the outside user. This can be done with

the following FlittonFibNumberAdapter property:

    @property
    def count(self) -> int:
        return self._counter.value

9.  Again, the counter interface is clean, so no explanation is needed. Our adapter

interface is now completed. All we need to do is expose it to the user by importing it
into the src/__init__.py file with the following code:

from .fib_number_adapter import \
  FlittonFibNumberAdapter

Everything is done. We can now update our GitHub repository and reinstall our package
in the Python environment.

Building a Rust interface with the pyO3 crate     165

Testing our adapter interface in the Python console

We can now test our adapter with the Python console commands, as shown here:

>>> from flitton_fib_rs import FlittonFibNumberAdapter
>>> test = FlittonFibNumberAdapter(10)
>>> test_two = FlittonFibNumberAdapter(15)
>>> test_two.count
2
>>> test.count
2
>>> test_two.success
True
>>> test_two.result
610

Here, we can see that we can import our adapter from the module. We can then define
two different adapters. We can see that the count is consistent across both adapters, which
means that our singleton pattern works! Both adapters are pointing to the same Counter
instance! All of our adapters will point to that same Counter instance. We can also see
that the success is True, and we can access the result of the calculation:

1.  Now, in the same Python console, we can test to see whether an incorrect input
results in a failure and doesn't increase the count with the Python console
commands shown next:

>>> test_three = FlittonFibNumberAdapter(
                               "should fail"
                             )
>>> test_three.count
2
>>> test_three.result
>>> test_three.success
False
>>> test_three.error_message
'input needs to be a list of ints or an int'
>>>

166     Creating a Rust Interface for Our pip Module

2.  Here, we can see that the count hasn't increased, the success is False, and that
there is an error message. The final input test can be done by inputting a list of
integers with the Python console command shown next:

>>> test_four = FlittonFibNumberAdapter(
                      [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
                   )
>>> test_four.result
[5, 8, 13, 21, 34]

Here, we can see that it works. There is only one final test that we really know will
work. However, it's to drive home what's happening with the singleton pattern. If
we call all of the counts for all four adapters, they should all be 3, as they are all
pointing to the same Counter instance and there was one failure out of the four.

3.  Calling them in the same Python console command reveals whether this is true, as

shown next:

>>> test.count
3
>>> test_two.count
3
>>> test_three.count
3
>>> test_four.count
3

There we have it. We have fully configured the Python interface of our module.

In this section, we built our Rust pip package with a Python interface. You might be
tempted to add extra directories and flesh out entire Python modules in the flitton_
fib_rs directory. However, extra directories in the flitton_fib_rs directory do not
get copied over when the package is being installed. This is fine as well. We are essentially
building Rust pip packages. Rust is fast and safe, and we should be leaning on this as
much as we can. The Python adapters and command in the flitton_fib_rs directory
should be there to smooth over the interface. For instance, if we want the memory of our
interface to be managed in a particular way, it makes sense to do this in the interface of
Python as a wrapper, as Python will be the system that is importing and using the pip
package. If you find yourself putting anything other than adapters and command-line
functions in the flitton_fib_rs module, that is a warning sign that you should try
and consider putting it in the Rust module itself. We have tested our package manually;
however, we need to ensure that our Rust Fibonacci calculation functions do as we expect.

Building tests for our Rust package     167

In the next section, we will be creating unit tests for our Rust code.

Building tests for our Rust package
Previously, in Chapter 4, Building pip Modules in Python, we built unit tests for our Python
code. In this section, we will build unit tests for our Fibonacci functions. These tests do
not need any extra packages or dependencies. We can use Cargo to manage our testing.
This can be done by adding our testing code in the src/fib_calcs/fib_number.rs
file. The steps are as follows:

1.  We do this by creating a module in the src/fib_calcs/fib_number.rs file

with the following code:

#[cfg(test)]
mod fibonacci_number_tests {
      use super::fibonacci_number;
}

Here, we can see that we have defined a module in the same file and decorated the
module with the #[cfg(test)] macro.

2.  We can also see that we must import the function, as it is super to the module.

Inside this module, we can run standard tests that check to see whether the integers
we pass in calculate the Fibonacci number we expect with the following code:

     #[test]
     fn test_one() {
          assert_eq!(fibonacci_number(1), 1);
     }
     #[test]
     fn test_two() {
          assert_eq!(fibonacci_number(2), 1);
     }
     #[test]
     fn test_three() {
           assert_eq!(fibonacci_number(3), 2);
     }
     #[test]
     fn test_twenty() {

168     Creating a Rust Interface for Our pip Module

           assert_eq!(fibonacci_number(20), 6765);
     }

Here, we can see that we have decorated our test functions with the #[test]
macro. If they do not produce the results that we expect, then assert_eq! and
the test will fail. We also must note that our function will panic if we pass in zero or
a negative value.

3.  These can be tested with the test functions, as shown next:

      #[test]
      #[should_panic]
      fn test_0() {
          fibonacci_number(0);
      }
      #[test]
      #[should_panic]
      fn test_negative() {
          fibonacci_number(-20);
      }

Here, we pass in the failing inputs. If they do not panic, then the test will fail
because we decorated it with the #[should_panic] macro.

4.  Now that we have created our tests for the fibonacci_number function, we can
build our test for our fibonacci_numbers function in the src/fib_calcs/
fib_numbers.rs file with the following code:

#[cfg(test)]
mod fibonacci_numbers_tests {

      use super::fibonacci_numbers;

      #[test]
      fn test_run() {
      let outcome = fibonacci_numbers([1, 2, 3, \
        4].to_vec());
        assert_eq!(outcome, [1, 1, 2, 3]);
      }
}

5.  Here, we can see that this has the same layout as our other tests. If we want to run

our tests, we can run them with the following command:

This gives us the following printout:

170     Creating a Rust Interface for Our pip Module

Here, we can see that all of our tests have run and passed. If we recall Chapter 4, Building
pip Modules in Python, we'll remember that we used mocking.

Rust is still developing mock crates. One crate, mockall, enables mocking and can be
found at this URL: https://docs.rs/mockall/0.10.0/mockall/. Another
cleaner crate that can be utilized for mocking can be found at this URL: https://
docs.rs/mocktopus/0.7.11/mocktopus/.

We have now covered how to build our module and test it. We are at the end of building
a Rust pip module with tests and a Python interface. We can now test the speed of our
Rust module to see what will happen and how powerful Rust modules as a tool are.

Comparing speed with Python, Rust, and
Numba
We have now built a pip module in Rust with command-line tools, Python interfaces,
and unit tests. This is a shiny new tool that we have. Let's put it to the test. We know that
Rust by itself is faster than Python. However, do we know that the pyo3 bindings slow us
down? Also, there is another way to speed up our Python code and this is with Numba,
a Python package that compiles Python code to speed it up. Should we go through all
of the haste of creating the Rust package if we can achieve the same speed with Numba?
In this section, we will run our Fibonacci function several times, in Python, Numba,
and our Rust module. It has to be noted that Numba can be a headache to install. For
instance, I could not install it on my MacBook Pro M1. I had to install Numba on a Linux
laptop to run this section. You don't have to run the code in this section; it is more for
demonstrative purposes. If you do want to try and run the test script, then all of the steps
are provided:

1.  First of all, we have to install the Rust pip module that we have built. We then

install Numba with the following command:

pip install numba

2.  Once this is done, we have everything we need. In any Python script, we import the

packages required with the following code:

from time import time

from flitton_fib_rs.flitton_fib_rs import \
  fibonacci_number
from numba import jit

Comparing speed with Python, Rust, and Numba     171

We are using the time module to time how long it takes for each run to happen.
We also use the Fibonacci function from our Rust pip module, and we also require
the jit decorator from Numba. jit stands for just in time. This is because Numba
compiles the function when it loads it.

3.  We now define our standard Python function with the following code:

def python_fib_number(number: int) -> int:
    if number < 0:
        raise ValueError(
            "Fibonacci has to be equal or above zero"
        )
    elif number in [1, 2]:
        return 1
    else:
        return numba_fib_number(number - 1) + \
               numba_fib_number(number - 2)

4.  We can see that this is the same logic that the Rust code is built with. We want to

ensure that our tests are reputable comparisons. We then define the Python function
that is compiled with jit with the following code:

@jit(nopython=True)
def numba_fib_number(number: int) -> int:
    if number < 0:
        raise ValueError("Fibonacci has to be equal \
          or above zero")
    elif number in [1, 2]:
        return 1
    else:
        return numba_fib_number(number - 1) + \
               numba_fib_number(number - 2)

5.  We can see that it is the same. The only difference is that we have decorated it with

jit and set nopython to True to obtain optimal performance. We then run all of
them with the following code:

t0 = time()
for i in range(0, 30):
    numba_fib_number(35)

172     Creating a Rust Interface for Our pip Module

t1 = time()
print(f"the time taken for numba is: {t1-t0}")
t0 = time()
for i in range(0, 30):
    numba_fib_number(35)
t1 = time()
print(f"the time taken for numba is: {t1 - t0}")

Here, we can see that we loop through a range from 0 to 30 and hit our function
30 times with the number 35. We then print the time elapsed for this to happen.
We notice that we have done this twice. This is because the first run will involve
compiling the function.

6.  When we run this, we get the following console printout:

the time taken for numba is: 2.6187334060668945
the time taken for numba is: 2.4959869384765625

7.  Here, we can see that some time is shaved off in the second run because it is not

compiling. Running this several times shows that this reduction is standard. Now,
we set up our standard Python test with the following code:

t0 = time()
for i in range(0, 30):
    python_fib_number(35)
t1 = time()
print(f"the time taken for python is: {t1 - t0}")

8.  Running this test will get the following console printout:

the time taken for python is: 2.889884853363037

9.  We can see that there is a significant speed decrease when it comes to running pure
Python code as opposed to our Numba function. Now, we can move on to the final
test, which is our Rust test, defined with the following code:

t0 = time()
for i in range(0, 30):
    fibonacci_number(35)
t1 = time()
print(f"the time taken for rust is: {t1 - t0}")

Summary     173

10.  Running this test gives us the following console printout:

the time taken for rust is: 0.9373788833618164

Here, we can see that the Rust function is a lot faster. This does not mean that Numba
is a waste of time. When it comes to Python optimizations, Numba can perform well in
certain situations. In other situations, the Python optimizations will not affect them at all.
Considering how easy they are to apply, it is always worth checking to see whether there
is a speed-up. However, we also now know that Rust will always be faster than pure
Python code.

Summary
In this chapter, we have built a fully fleshed-out Python pip module with command-line
tools, interfaces, and Rust code. We managed gitignore for both Rust and Python
development. We then defined our setup tools for packaging our Python code and module
with the compilation of Rust code that has Python bindings. Once these were defined,
we learned how to build Rust functions that spanned multiple Rust files that could be
wrapped in pyo3 bindings.

Our development did not just stop at Rust. We also explored Python's singleton and
adapter design patterns to build more advanced Python interfaces for our users. We then
tested our code with unit tests and speed checking. It must be noted that we did not cover
GitHub actions in this chapter. GitHub actions are defined in the same way as they were in
the previous chapter. Instead of running tests using the Python unit test, we run our tests
using Cargo and so on. However, uploading to PyPI is a little more complicated. To cover
this, examples on how to pre-compile and upload Rust pip modules are provided in the
Further reading section.

We now have a powerful skill, which is building Python pip modules that utilize Rust.
However, we leaned on our Python to build our interfaces. In the next chapter, we will
work with Python objects within our Rust code. Therefore, we will be able to pass in more
advanced Python data objects into our Rust code. We will also enable our Rust code to
return fully fledged Python objects.

Questions

1.  How do you define a setup.py file for a pyo3 Rust Python pip module?
2.  What is the layout of our pip module in the Python environment after it has

been installed? Also, why can we not build Python modules spanning multiple
directories?

174     Creating a Rust Interface for Our pip Module

3.  What is a singleton design pattern?

4.  What is an adapter design pattern and what are the advantages of using the

design pattern?

5.  What is a metaclass and how do we use it?

Answers

1.  Here, we must use the dist package to install setuptools_rust before we do

anything else in the setup.py file. We define the parameters for the setup and use
the RustExtension object from setuptools_rust, pointing to where the
compiled Rust module will be once installed.

2.  When the pip module is installed, the binary Rust file is in the same directory
where the Python files are defined for the module. However, directories in that
directory are not copied over and, therefore, they will be lost during the installation.

3.  A singleton design pattern ensures that all references to a particular class all point

to one instance of that class.

4.  The adapter pattern is an interface that manages the interaction between two

modules. The advantage is the flexibility between the modules. We know where all
the interactions are, and if we want to sever the modules, all we need to do is delete
the adapter. This enables us to switch modules as and when we need them.

5.  A metaclass is a class that lies between a type and an object. Because of this, we can

use this to see how we manage calling our objects.

Working
with Python
Objects in Rust

So far, we have managed to fuse Rust with Python to speed up our code. However,
software programs written in Rust can get complicated. While we can get by with passing
integers and strings into Rust functions from Python code, it would be useful to handle
more complex data structures from Python and objects. In this chapter, we accept and
process Python data structures such as a dictionary. We will go further by processing
custom Python objects and even creating Python objects inside our Rust code.

In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

•  Passing complex Python objects into Rust

•  Inspecting and working with custom Python objects

•  Constructing our own custom Python objects in Rust

176     Working with Python Objects in Rust

Technical requirements
The code for this chapter can be found via the following GitHub link:

https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Speed-up-your-Python-with-
Rust/tree/main/chapter_six

Passing complex Python objects into Rust
A key skill that enables us to take our Rust pip module development to the next level is
taking in complex Python data structures/objects and using them. In Chapter 5, Creating
a Rust Interface for Our pip Module, we accepted integers. We noticed that these raw
integers were just directly transferred to our Rust function. However, with Python objects,
it is more complex than this.

To explore this, we will create a new command-line function that reads a .yml file and
passes a Python dictionary into our Rust function. The data in this dictionary will have
the parameters needed for firing our fibonacci_numbers and fibonacci_number
Rust functions, adding the results of those functions to the Python dictionary and passing
it back to the Python system.

To achieve this, we must carry out the following steps:

1.  Update our setup.py file to support .yml loading and a command-line function

that reads it.

2.  Define a command-line function that reads the .yml file and feeds it into Rust.
3.  Process data from our Python dictionary for fibonacci_numbers in Rust.

4.  Extract data from our config file.

5.  Return our Python dictionary to our Python system.

This approach will require us to write the whole process before we can run it. This can be
frustrating because we cannot see it working until the end. However, it is laid out in this
book this way so that we can see the data flow. We are exploring the concept of passing
complex data structures into Rust for the first time. Once we understand how this works,
we can then develop pip modules that work for us as individuals.

Passing complex Python objects into Rust     177

Updating our setup.py file to support .yml loading
 Let's start this journey by updating our setup.py file, as follows:

1.  With our new command-line function, we read a .yml file and pass through
that data to our Rust function. This requires our Python pip module to have
the pyyaml Python module. This can be done by adding the requirements
parameter to our setup initialization, as follows:

    requirements=[
        "pyyaml>=3.13"
    ]

We remember that we can keep adding more dependencies to our module by just
adding them to our requirements list. If we want our module to be more flexible
for multiple installs to different systems, it is advised that we can lower the version
number for our pyyaml module requirement.

2.  Now that we have defined our requirements, we can define a new console script,
resulting in the entry_points parameter in our setup initialization, which
looks like this:

    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [
            'fib-number = flitton_fib_rs.'
            'fib_number_command:'
            'fib_number_command',
            'config-fib = flitton_fib_rs.'
            'config_number_command:'
            'config_number_command',
        ],
    },

With this, we can see that our new console script will be in the flitton_fib_
rs/config_number_command.py directory.
In the flitton_fib_rs/config_number_command.py directory, we need to
build a function called config_number_command. First, we need to import the
required modules, as follows:

3.

import argparse
import yaml
import os

178     Working with Python Objects in Rust

from pprint import pprint

from .flitton_fib_rs import run_config

os will help us with the path definition to the .yml file. The pprint function will just
help us print the data in an easy-to-read format on the console. We have also defined a
Rust function that will process our dictionary as run_config.

Defining our .yml loading command
Now that our imports have been done, we can define our function and collect the
command-line arguments. Here's how we do this:

1.  You can start with the following code:

def config_number_command() -> None:
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        description='Calculate Fibonacci numbers '
                    'using a config file')
    parser.add_argument('--path', action='store',
                        type=str, required=True,
                        help="path to config file")
    args = parser.parse_args()

2.  Here, we can see that we take in a string, which is the path to the .yml file with the
--path tag, and we parse it. Now that we have parsed the path, we can open our
.yml file by running the following code:

    with open(str(os.getcwd()) + "/" + args.path) as \
      f:
        config_data: dict = yaml.safe_load(f)

Here, we can see that we attach our path with the os.getcwd() function. This is
because we must know where the user is calling the command. For instance, if we
are in the x/y/ directory and we want to point to the x/y/z.yml file, we will have
to run the config-fib --path z.yml command. If the directory of the file
were x/y/test/z.yml, we would have had to run the config-fib --path
test/z.yml command.

Passing complex Python objects into Rust     179

3.  Now that we have our data loaded from the .yml file, we can print it out and print

out the results of our Rust function by running the following code:

    print("Here is the config data: ")
    pprint(config_data)
    print(f"Here is the result:")
    pprint(run_config(config_data))

With this, we have now completed all our Python code.

Processing data from our Python dictionary
We are now going to have to build Rust functions that process the Python dictionaries.
Here's how we'll go about this:

1.  When it comes to processing input dictionaries, we must agree on a format that we
are going to accept. To keep this simple, our Python dictionaries will have two keys.
The number key is for a list of integers that can call Fibonacci number calculations
individually, while the numbers key is for a list of lists of integers. To ensure that
our Rust code does not become disorganized, we are going to define our interfaces
in our own interface directory, giving our Rust code the following structure:

├── fib_calcs
│   ├── fib_number.rs
│   ├── fib_numbers.rs
│   └── mod.rs
├── interface
│   ├── config.rs
│   └── mod.rs
├── lib.rs
└── main.rs

2.  We will build our configuration interface in the src/interface/config.rs
file. First, we are going to import all the functions and macros that we need,
as follows:

use pyo3::prelude::{pyfunction, PyResult};
use pyo3::types::{PyDict, PyList};
use pyo3::exceptions::PyTypeError;

180     Working with Python Objects in Rust

use crate::fib_calcs::fib_number::fibonacci_number;
use crate::fib_calcs::fib_numbers::fibonacci_numbers;

We are going to use pyfunction to wrap our interface that takes in a Python
dictionary. We will return the dictionary back to the Python program wrapped in
a pyResult struct. Seeing as we are accepting a Python dictionary, we will be
using a PyDict struct to describe the dictionary being passed in and returned.
We will also be accessing the lists in the dictionary using a PyList struct. If there
is an issue with our dictionary not housing lists, then we will have to throw an error
that the Python system will understand. To do this, we will use a PyTypeError
struct. Finally, we will be using our Fibonacci number functions to calculate
the Fibonacci numbers. We can see that we are simply importing from another
module in the Rust code with use crate::. Even though our Fibonacci number
functions have the pyfunction macro applied to them, nothing is stopping us
from using them as normal Rust functions elsewhere in our Rust code.

3.  Before we write our interface function, we need to build a private function that
accepts our lists of lists, calculates the Fibonacci numbers, and returns them in
a list of lists, as seen in the following code snippet:

fn process_numbers(input_numbers: Vec<Vec<i32>>) \
    -> Vec<Vec<u64>> {
    let mut buffer: Vec<Vec<u64>> = Vec::new();
    for i in input_numbers {
        buffer.push(fibonacci_numbers(i));
    }
    return buffer
}

4.  This should be straightforward at this stage in the book. Considering this, we
now have everything we need to build our interface. First, we need to define a
pyfunction function that accepts and returns the same data by running the
following code:

#[pyfunction]
pub fn run_config<'a>(config: &'a PyDict) \
    -> PyResult<&'a PyDict> {

Passing complex Python objects into Rust     181

Here, we can see that we tell the Rust compiler that the Python dictionary that we
accept must have the same lifetime as the Python dictionary that we are returning.
This makes sense as we are returning the same dictionary after adding the results
to it.

5.  Our first process is to see if the number key is present in the dictionary by running

the following code:

    match config.get_item("number") {
        Some(data) => {
            . . .
        },
        None => println!(
        "parameter number is not in the config"
        )
    }

Here, we can see that is the number key is not there, so we merely print that it is
not there. We can change the rules to throw an error instead, but we are accepting a
forgiving config file. If the user does not have any individual Fibonacci numbers
to compute, only lists of them, then we should not throw errors, insisting that the
user adds the field. The three dots in the code snippet shown in Step 6 are where the
code is going to be executed if the number key is present.

6.  We substitute the three dots in the following code snippet:

            match data.downcast::<PyList>() {
                Ok(raw_data) => {
                    . . .
                },
                Err(_) => Err(PyTypeError::new_err(
                    "parameter number is not a list
                    of integers")).unwrap()
            }

182     Working with Python Objects in Rust

Here, we can see that we downcast the data we extracted belonging to the number
key to the PyList struct. If this fails, then we actively throw a type error because
the user has tried to configure the number key but failed. If it passes, we can run
the Fibonacci function by substituting the three dots in the preceding code snippet
with the following code:

                    let processed_results: Vec<i32> =
              raw_data.extract::<Vec<i32>>().unwrap();
                    let fib_numbers: Vec<u64> =
                    processed_results.iter().map(
                        |x| fibonacci_number(*x)
                    ).collect();
                    config.set_item(
                    "NUMBER RESULT", fib_numbers);

Here, what we have done is create Vec<i32> by running the extract function on the
PyList struct. We directly unwrap it so that if there is an error, it will be thrown straight
away. We then create Vec<u64>, which houses the calculated Fibonacci numbers, by
iterating through the vector with the iter() function. We then map each i32 integer
of that vector with the map function. Inside the map function, we define a closure
that is mapped to each i32 integer in the vector. It must be noted that we apply the
fibonacci function where we dereference the i32 integer being passed in because it is
now a borrowed reference. We collect the results of this mapping with the .collect()
function, which results in the processed_results variable being a collection of i32
calculated Fibonacci numbers. We then add the calculated numbers to the dictionary
under the NUMBER RESULT key. We can see the flow of what was just described in the
following diagram:

Passing complex Python objects into Rust     183

Figure 6.1 – Data extraction flow

In the next step, we will carry out a similar process to the one displayed in Figure 6.1 to
process the list of lists under the numbers key.

Extracting data from our config file
At this point, it would be a good idea to try to implement the process for the numbers
key by yourself. To make things easier, you can use the process_numbers function that
we defined earlier in Step 3 of the Processing data from our Python dictionary section. We
will cover the solution to this in the next steps:

1.  The numbers key can be processed by our run_config function with the code

defined here:

    match config.get_item("numbers") {
        Some(data) => {
            match data.downcast::<PyList>() {

184     Working with Python Objects in Rust

                Ok(raw_data) => {
                    let processed_results_two: \
                      Vec<Vec<i32>> =
                    raw_data.extract::<Vec<Vec<i32>>>(
                    ).unwrap();
                    config.set_item("NUMBERS RESULT",
                    process_numbers(processed \
                      _results_two));
                },
                Err(_) => Err(PyTypeError::new_err(
                "parameter numbers is not a list of \
                   lists of integers")).unwrap()
            }

        },
        None => println!(
        "parameter numbers is not in the config")
    }
    return Ok(config)

Here, we can see that the process_numbers function actually makes this
implementation simpler than the numbers key processing. If the complexity starts
to grow, it is always worth breaking down the logic into smaller functions. It also
must be noted that we return a result that wraps the config dictionary. Now that
we have finished the logic behind processing our dictionary, we need to return our
dictionary in the next step.

2.  Here, we must publicly define our src/interface/config.rs file in the src/

interface/mod.rs file by running the following code:

pub mod config;

3.  We then import it into our src/lib.rs file by running the following code:

mod interface;

use interface::config::__pyo3_get_function_run_config;

Passing complex Python objects into Rust     185

4.  We then add the function to our module in the src/lib.rs file by running the

following code:

m.add_wrapped(wrap_pyfunction!(run_config));

We have now carried out all the steps.

Returning our Rust dictionary to our Python system
Our pip module can now take in a configuration file, convert it into a Python dictionary,
pass the Python dictionary into the Rust function that calculates the Fibonacci numbers,
and return the results in the form of a dictionary back to Python. This can be achieved by
carrying out the following steps:

1.  Define a .yml file to be ingested by our program. An example .yml file that can

run what we have just done can be defined via the following code:

number:
  - 4
  - 7
  - 2
numbers:
  -
    - 12
    - 15
    - 20
  -
    - 15
    - 19
    - 18

I have saved the preceding .yml code on my desktop for demonstration purposes
under the filename example.yml. Remember to update your GitHub repository
and uninstall your current module in your Python environment, and install our
new module instead.

2.  We can then pass in the .yml file into our module entry point with the following

command:

config-fib --path example.yml

186     Working with Python Objects in Rust

3.

I ran this command from my desktop, where I stored the example.yml file.
Running the previous command gives us the following output:

Here is the config data:
{'number': [4, 7, 2, 10, 15],
 'numbers': [[5, 8, 12, 15, 20], [12, 15, 19, 18, 8]]}
Here is the result:
{'NUMBER RESULT': [3, 13, 1, 55, 610],
 'NUMBERS RESULT': [[5, 21, 144, 610, 6765],
                    [144, 610, 4181, 2584, 21]],
 'number': [4, 7, 2, 10, 15],
 'numbers': [[5, 8, 12, 15, 20], [12, 15, 19, 18, 8]]}

Here, we can see that our Python interface fed the Python dictionary into the
Rust interface. We then got the results of the Fibonacci functions passed back in
the same dictionary.

4.  Now, we introduce a breaking change in our .yml file. We can test our error by
changing the number key to a dictionary as opposed to a list of integers in our
example.yml file by running the following code:

number:
  one: 1

5.  Finally we run our code again, expecting the correct error message. This gives us the

following error when running our command again:

pyo3_runtime.PanicException: called 'Result::unwrap()'
on an 'Err' value: PyErr { type: <class 'TypeError'>,
value: TypeError('parameter number is not a list of
integers'),
traceback: None }

Here, we can see that a TypeError exception was raised. This is not trivial.
This means that we can try to accept type errors in our Python code when using
our Rust module if we need to. Considering this, if a user did not know how our
module was built, they would have no problem thinking that our module was built
in pure Python. There is one more test that we can consider. We only manually
threw an error when we were downcasting to PyList, highlighting that we need
to have a list of integers. However, we just unwrapped the extract function being
performed on PyList.

Inspecting and working with custom Python objects     187

6.  We can see how the extract function handles a string being put in, thereby

changing the number key to a list of strings as opposed to a list of integers in our
example.yml file, by running the following code:

number:
  - "test"

7.  Running our command again gives us the following output:

pyo3_runtime.PanicException: called 'Result:: \
  unwrap()' on an
'Err' value: PyErr { type: <class 'TypeError'>,
value: TypeError(
"'str' object cannot be interpreted as an integer"),
traceback: None }

Here, we can see that the error string is a little harder to interpret because we did not
directly code an error telling the user what we want; however, it is still TypeError.
We can also see here that errors raised by functions that are acted on Python objects are
Python-friendly.

We have now concluded how to interact with complex Python data structures. Nothing
is stopping you from building Python pip modules in Rust that fuse seamlessly with
a Python program. However, we can take our Rust pip modules to the next level by
working with and inspecting custom Python objects in the next section.

Inspecting and working with custom Python
objects
Technically, everything in Python is an object. The Python dictionary that we worked
on within the previous section is an object, so we have already managed Python objects.
However, as we know, Python enables us to build custom objects. In this section, we
will get our Rust function to accept a custom Python class that will have number and
numbers attributes. To achieve this, we must carry out the following steps:

1.  Create an object that passes itself into our Rust interface.

2.  Acquire the Python global interpreter lock (GIL) within our Rust code to create

a PyDict struct.

3.  Add the custom object's attributes to our newly created PyDict struct.
4.  Set the attributes of the custom object to the results of our run_config function.

188     Working with Python Objects in Rust

Creating an object for our Rust interface
We start our journey by setting up our interface object, as follows:

1.  We house our object that will pass itself into our Rust code in the flitton_fib_
rs/object_interface.py file. Initially, we import what we need by running
the following code:

from typing import List, Optional

from .flitton_fib_rs import object_interface

2.  We then define the __init__ method of our object by running the following code:

class ObjectInterface:

    def __init__(self, number: List[int], \
       numbers: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        self.number: List[int] = number
        self.numbers: List[List[int]] = numbers
        self.number_results: Optional[List[int]] = \
          None
        self.numbers_results:Optional[List[List \
          [int]]] = None

Here, we can see that we can pass in the Fibonacci numbers that we want to be
calculated in the parameters. We then just set our attributes to the parameters
that we passed in. The result parameters defined here are of a None value. However,
they will be populated by the Rust code when we pass this object into our Rust
object interface.

3.  We then define a function that will pass our object into the Rust code by running

the following code:

    def process(self) -> None:
        object_interface(self)

Inspecting and working with custom Python objects     189

Here, we can see that this is done by merely passing the self reference into the function.
Now that we have defined our object, we can move on to build our interface and interact
with the Python GIL.

Acquiring the Python GIL in Rust
For our interface, we will house our function in the src/interface/object.rs file.
We'll proceed as follows:

1.  First, we must import all of what we need by running the following code:

use pyo3::prelude::{pyfunction, PyResult, Python};
use pyo3::types::{PyAny, PyDict};
use pyo3::exceptions::PyLookupError;

use super::config::run_config;

Most of these imports will be familiar by now. The new import that we must make
note of is the Python import. Python is a struct that is essentially a marker that is
required for the Python operations that we will be doing.

2.  Now that we have imported everything we need, we can build parameters for our

interface and create a PyDict struct by running the following code:

#[pyfunction]
pub fn object_interface<'a>(input_object: &'a PyAny) \
    -> PyResult<&'a PyAny> {
    let gil = Python::acquire_gil();
    let py = gil.python();

    let config_dict: &PyDict = PyDict::new(py);

190     Working with Python Objects in Rust

Here, what we have essentially done is acquire the Python GIL, and then use this to
create a PyDict struct. To fully understand what we are doing, it is best to explore what
the Python GIL is. In Chapter 3, Understanding Concurrency, we covered the concept of
thread blocking. This means that if another thread is executing, then all other threads are
locked. The GIL ensures that this happens, as demonstrated in the following diagram:

Figure 6.2 – GIL flow

This is because Python does not have any concept of ownership. A Python object can be
referenced as many times as we want. We can also mutate the variable from any of those
references. When we acquire the gil variable, we ensure that only one thread can use
the Python interpreter and the Python application programming interface (API) at
the same time. We must remember that processes behave differently and have their own
memory. Our gil variable is a GILGuard struct that ensures that we acquire the GIL
before we run any operations on Python objects.

Inspecting and working with custom Python objects     191

Adding data to our newly created PyDict struct
Now that we have control over Python objects with the GIL, we can move on to our next
step, where we add the data from the input object to our newly created PyDict struct,
as follows:

1.  Our approach in this step can be summarized in the following diagram:

2.  We can achieve the first cycle depicted in Figure 6.3 by running the following code:

Figure 6.3 – PyDict flow

    match input_object.getattr("number") {
        Ok(data) => {
            config_dict.set_item("number", data) \
              .unwrap();
        },
        Err(_) => Err(PyLookupError::new_err(
            "attribute number is missing")).unwrap()
    }

192     Working with Python Objects in Rust

Here, we can see that we match the getattr function, throwing an error if
input_object does not have the number attribute. If we do have the attribute,
we assign it to config_dict.

3.  We can do the second cycle by running the following code:

    match input_object.getattr("numbers") {
        Ok(data) => {
            config_dict.set_item("numbers", data) \
              .unwrap();
        }
        Err(_) => Err(PyLookupError::new_err(
            "attribute numbers is missing")).unwrap()
    }

4.

It must be noted that there is a fair amount of repetition, with only one change.
We could refactor this into a single function with an attribute parameter by
running the following code:

fn extract_data<'a>(input_object: &'a PyAny, \
    attribute: &'a str, config_dict: &'a PyDict) \
      -> &'a PyDict {
    match input_object.getattr(attribute) {
        Ok(data) => {
            config_dict.set_item(attribute, \
              data).unwrap();
        },
        Err(_) => Err(PyLookupError::new_err(
            "attribute number is missing")).unwrap()
    }
    return config_dict
}

5.  Here, we can see that we get a lot of flexibility with our Python objects. This

function can be used multiple times with the refactored code in our object_
interface function, as seen here:

    let mut config_dict: &PyDict = PyDict::new(py);
    config_dict = extract_data(input_object, \
      "number", config_dict);

Inspecting and working with custom Python objects     193

    config_dict = extract_data(input_object,
      "numbers", config_dict);

Here, we can see that we have changed config_dict to a mutable. Now that we have
loaded our PyDict struct with all the data that we need, all we must do is run our
run_config function, add it to the input object's attributes, and return it to the Python
interface in the next step.

Setting the attributes of our custom object
We are now in the final stage of our interface module. Here are the steps:

1.  We can pass the output from our run_config function to our Python object

interface by running the following code:

    let output_dict: &PyDict = run_config( \
      config_dict).unwrap();

    input_object.setattr(
        "number_results",
        output_dict.get_item(
            "NUMBER RESULT").unwrap()).unwrap();

    input_object.setattr(
        "numbers_results",
        output_dict.get_item(
            "NUMBERS RESULT").unwrap()).unwrap();

    return Ok(input_object)

Here, we can see that we get the output_dict Python dictionary from the
run_config function. Once we have got this, we set the input_object
attribute based on the items from output_dict.

2.  We have now completed our interface and we must subsequently plug it into our

Rust module. We publicly define our interface file in the src/interface/mod.
rs file by running the following code:

pub mod object;

194     Working with Python Objects in Rust

3.  We can then define our interface function in our Rust module by importing it into

our src/lib.rs file, as follows:

use interface::object::__pyo3_get_function_object_ \
  interface;

4.  We then add our function to our module, as follows:

    m.add_wrapped(wrap_pyfunction!(object_interface));

5.  Our module is now fully functioning. As always, we must remember to update

our GitHub repository, uninstall our old module in our Python environment, and
reinstall it. Once this is done, we can test it by running a Python shell. In our shell,
we can test our object by running the following code:

>>> from flitton_fib_rs.object_interface import
ObjectInterface
>>> test = ObjectInterface([5, 6, 7, 8], [])
>>> test.process()
>>> test.number_results
[5, 8, 13, 21]

Here, we can see that we import the object that we are going to use. We then initialize
it and run the process function. Once this is done, we can see that our Rust code
accepted our object and interacted with it as we have the correct results for our
number_results attribute.

Now we can interact with Python custom objects, the problems we can solve and how
we can interact with the Python system are powerful. Custom Python objects do not
hold us back. However, it is important not to get too carried away with Python objects
in our Rust code. While we should use them in our interface, we shouldn't have to rely
on them to build the whole program. In this section, we did do this, as we were leaning
on a function that we built in the previous section to avoid excessive code, to get a
point across. However, in your projects, Python objects should leave your code after the
interface. If you find yourself using Python objects in your Rust code throughout, then
you must ask yourself why you are not just using pure Python. Coding in Python will be
slower than coding in Rust, but the metaclass, dynamic attributes, and many other Python
features will make coding in Python easier and more enjoyable than trying to force a
Python style of coding into Rust. Rust offers structs, traits, enums, and strong typing with
lifetimes that get cut after moving out of scope to keep resources low.

Constructing our own custom Python objects in Rust     195

So, lean into this style of coding to fully reap the benefits of building pip modules in
Rust. Push past your comfort zone of the Python coding style. The next section is about
building Python objects in Rust code.

Constructing our own custom Python objects
in Rust
In this final section, we will build a Python module in Rust that can be interacted with
in the Python system as if it were a native Python object. To do this, we must follow
these steps:

1.  Define a Python class with all our attributes.

2.  Define class static methods to process numbers.

3.  Define a class constructor.

Defining a Python class with the required attributes
To start our journey, we define our class in the src/class_module/fib_
processor.rs file, as follows:

1.  To build our class, we need to import the required macros by running the

following code:

use pyo3::prelude::{pyclass, pymethods, staticmethod};

use crate::fib_calcs::fib_number::fibonacci_number;
use crate::fib_calcs::fib_numbers::fibonacci_numbers;

Here, we are using the pyclass macro to define our Rust Python class. We then
use pymethods and staticmethod to define methods attached to the class. We
also use standard Fibonacci numbers to calculate the Fibonacci numbers.

2.  Now that we have imported everything we need, we can define the class and the

attributes, as follows:

#[pyclass]
pub struct FibProcessor {
    #[pyo3(get, set)]
    pub number: Vec<i32>,
    #[pyo3(get, set)]
    pub numbers: Vec<Vec<i32>>,

196     Working with Python Objects in Rust

    #[pyo3(get)]
    pub number_results: Vec<u64>,
    #[pyo3(get)]
    pub numbers_results: Vec<Vec<u64>>
}

Here, we can see that we use Rust typing for our attributes. We also use a macro to state
what we can do with these attributes. For our number and numbers attributes, we can
get and set data belonging to these attributes. However, with our results attributes, we
can only get data as this is set by the calculations.

Defining class static methods to process input
numbers
We can now use our attributes to implement class methods.

Just as with standard structs, we can implement methods attached to the class with an
impl block, as seen in the following code snippet:

#[pymethods]
impl FibProcessor {

    #[staticmethod]
    fn process_numbers(input_numbers: Vec<Vec<i32>>) \
      -> Vec<Vec<u64>> {
        let mut buffer: Vec<Vec<u64>> = Vec::new();
        for i in input_numbers {
            buffer.push(fibonacci_numbers(i));
        }
        return buffer
    }
}

Here, we can see that we have applied the pymethods macro to our impl block. We
also apply the staticmethod macro to our process_numbers static method. This
function was used before, in the previous section, to process lists of lists. Now that our
static method is defined, we can use this in our constructor method in the next step.

Constructing our own custom Python objects in Rust     197

Defining a class constructor
Here are the steps we need to take:

1.  We can define our constructor method in our impl block by running the

following code:

    #[new]
    fn new(number: Vec<i32>, numbers: Vec<Vec<i32>>) \
      -> Self {
        let input_numbers: Vec<Vec<i32>> = \
          numbers.clone();
        let input_number: Vec<i32> = number.clone();

        let number_results: Vec<u64> =
          input_number.iter(
                             ).map(
            |x| fibonacci_number(*x)
        ).collect();

        let numbers_results: Vec<Vec<u64>> = Self::
                 process_numbers(input_numbers);
        return FibProcessor {number, numbers,
                 number_results, numbers_results}
    }

Here, we accept inputs for the calculations of the Fibonacci numbers. We then clone
them because we are going to pass them through the Fibonacci number functions.
Once this is done, we apply the fibonacci_number function by mapping the
input and collecting the results. We also collect the results from our static method.
Once all the data is calculated, we construct the class and return it. Once this is
done, all we must do is connect our class to our module.

2.  This can be done by publicly declaring our class file in the src/class_module/

mod.rs file, as follows:

pub mod fib_processor;

198     Working with Python Objects in Rust

3.  Now that this is done, we import it into our src/lib.rs file by running the

following code:

mod class_module;

use class_module::fib_processor::FibProcessor;

4.  Once this is done, we can add our class to our module in the same file, as follows:

m.add_class::<FibProcessor>()?;

We have now fully integrated our class into the pip module.

Wrapping up and testing our module
As always, when we get to the end of a section, we must remember to do the following:

•

•

•

 Update the GitHub repository.

 Uninstall the current pip module.

 Reinstall it in our Python environment.

Now that we have finished building our module and updated the installed version, we can
manually test our module in the Python system by following these next steps:

1.  We can open our Python shell and test our class by running the following code:

>>> from flitton_fib_rs.flitton_fib_rs import
FibProcessor
>>> test = FibProcessor([11, 12, 13, 14], [[11, 12],
                        [13, 14], [15, 16]])
>>> test.numbers_results
[[89, 144], [233, 377], [610, 987]]

2.  We can see that our Rust object works seamlessly in our Python system with

calculated results. We must remember that we have set rules around our attributes.
To check this, we can try to assign our results attribute, which will give us the
following output:

>>> test.numbers_results = "test"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>

Constructing our own custom Python objects in Rust     199

AttributeError: attribute 'numbers_results' of
'builtins.FibProcessor' objects is not writable

3.  Here, we can see that our results attribute is not writable. We can also test

typing. Although our number attribute is writable, it is supposed to be a vector of
integers. If we try to assign a string to this attribute, we get the following printout:

>>> test.number = "test"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'str' object cannot be interpreted as an
integer

4.  Here, we can see that our typing is also enforced, even though it looks and acts like
a native Python object. Finally, we can test to see if we can write a new value to the
number attribute by running the following code:

>>> test.number = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> test.number
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

It seems that we can write when the type and permissions are correct. Considering
all of this, what is the point of creating these classes? They make the interface for
our module smoother, but how much faster is this class?

To quantify this, we can create a simple testing Python script in our Python environment,
as follows:

1.  First, in our Python script, we import our Rust class and the time module by

running the following code:

from flitton_fib_rs.flitton_fib_rs import FibProcessor
import time

2.  We must now create a pure Python object with the same functionality in this script,

as follows:

class PythonFibProcessor:

     def __init__(self, number, numbers):
           self.number = number
           self.numbers = numbers
           self.numbers_results = None

200     Working with Python Objects in Rust

           self.number_results = None
           self._process()

     def _process(self):
           self.numbers_results = \
             [self.calculate_numbers(i)\
               for i in self.numbers]
           self.number_results = \
             self.calculate_numbers(
               self.number)

     def fibonacci_number(self, number):
         if number < 0:
             return None
         elif number <= 2:
             return 1
         else:
          return self.fibonacci_number(number - 1) + \
                    self.fibonacci_number(number - 2)

     def calculate_numbers(self, numbers):
          return [self.fibonacci_number(i) for i in \
            numbers]

3.  Now that our benchmark pure Python object is defined, we are now at the timing

stage of the script, where we put the same inputs into both classes and test them
with the following code:

t_one = time.time()
test = FibProcessor([11, 12, 13, 14], [[11, 12], \
    [13, 14], [15, 16]])
t_two = time.time()
print(t_two - t_one)

t_one = time.time()
test = PythonFibProcessor([11, 12, 13, 14], \
  [[11, 12], [13, 14], [15, 16]])

Constructing our own custom Python objects in Rust     201

t_two = time.time()
print(t_two - t_one)

4.  Running this gives us the following output:

1.4781951904296875e-05
0.0007779598236083984

This translates to the following:

0.000017881393432617188
0.0007779598236083984

Remember, the Rust class is the top reading. This means that our Rust class is 43 times
faster than our Python class! To put this into perspective, we can see the difference in the
following screenshot:

Figure 6.4 – Class speed difference between Rust and Python

Here, we can see that our class interfaces built in Rust are faster than our Python classes.
pyo3 supports class inheritance and other features. More resources on this are supplied
in the Further reading section. We now have a strong base when it comes to working with
Python objects in Rust. There are always more features to read up on, and these can be
built on top of the structures that we have built.

202     Working with Python Objects in Rust

Summary
In this chapter, we added a third-party pip module into our setup.py file so that we
could add another entry point that could read .yml files. We read the .yml file and passed
the data from that file in the form of a dictionary into our Rust functions, handling the
complex data structure under the PyDict struct. We then downcasted data from our
complex data structure into other Python objects and Rust data types. This gave us the
power to handle a range of Python data types passed into our Rust code, giving us extra
flexibility in how our Python code interacts with our Rust code.

We went one step further than complex Python data structures by accepting custom
Python objects under the PyAny struct. Once we accepted custom Python objects, we
could inspect attributes and set them as and when we wanted to. We even acquired the
Python GIL to create our own Python data structures to help us work with the custom
Python objects passed into our Rust code. To polish off our Python object skills, we
built Python classes within our Rust code that not only can be imported into the Python
system, acting just like a pure Python class, but are also 44 times faster. We now have
a powerful tool that will not only speed up our Python code but will also enable us to
interact with Python systems seamlessly.

In the next chapter, we tackle the final hurdle that is stopping us from infusing Rust into
every Python project we have. People reach for Python due to the extensive third-party
modules that are built for it, such as statistical and machine learning (ML) packages. We
will work with the third-party numpy module and use it in our Rust code. This will enable
us to utilize third-party Python modules in our Rust extension.

Questions

1.  How do you extract a vector of i32 integers from a PyDict struct?

2.

If we have a vector of strings but we apply a
.extract::<Vec<i32>>()  function on it and we directly unwrap it, what will
happen?

3.  How would you be able to loop through a Vec<i32> vector, doubling each item

4.

and packaging the results in another vector in one line of Rust code?
If we acquire the Python GIL to create a PyDict struct, will this affect the Python
system in any way?

5.  Although our Python classes built in our Rust code essentially run the same way as

our pure Python classes, there are some core differences. What are they?

1.  First, we must get a list from the PyDict struct by applying the get_item

function to PyDict. If there is data under the key that we use, we then perform
.downcast::<PyList>() to convert our data into a PyList struct. If we
achieve this, we then perform .extract::<Vec<i32>>() on the PyList
struct, giving us a Vec<i32>.

2.  Our extract function will automatically throw a PyTypeError Python-friendly

error.

3.  With this, we use the iter, map, and collect functions, as follows:

let results: Vec<i32> = some_vector.iter().map(
            |x| 2*x
        ).collect();

4.  No—the Python system that is running the code has already acquired the GIL.
If it does not have the GIL, it would just wait for another thread to finish before
acquiring the GIL.

5.  The typing system is still enforced. If we try to set an attribute that is a list of

integers to a string, an error will be thrown. Another difference is that set and get
macros for each attribute must be defined. If they are not, then the attribute cannot
be accessed or set.

Using Python
Modules with Rust

We have now become comfortable with writing Python packages in Rust that can be
installed using pip. However, a large advantage of Python is that it has a lot of mature
Python libraries that help us write productive code with minimal errors. This seems
a legitimate observation that could halt us from adopting Rust in our Python system.
However, in this chapter, we counter this observation by importing Python modules
into our Rust code and running Python code in our Rust code. To achieve an
understanding of this, we are going to use the NumPy Python package to implement
a basic mathematical model. Once this is done, we are going to use the NumPy package
in our Rust code to simplify the implementation of our mathematical model. Finally, we
will evaluate the speed of both implementations.

In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

•  Exploring NumPy

•  Building a model in NumPy

•  Using NumPy and other Python modules in Rust

•  Recreating our NumPy model in Rust

206     Using Python Modules with Rust

After completing this chapter, we will be able to import Python packages into our Rust
code and use it. This is powerful, as relying on a certain Python package would not hold us
back from implementing Rust in our Python systems for a certain task. The solutions that
we implement in this chapter using pure Python, Rust, and NumPy will also give us an
understanding of the trade-offs of each implementation when it comes to code complexity
and speed so that we do not try to implement a one-size-fits-all solution for every problem,
avoiding sub-optimal solutions.

Technical requirements
The code for this chapter can be found via the following GitHub link:

https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Speed-up-your-Python-with-
Rust/tree/main/chapter_seven

Exploring NumPy
Before we start using NumPy in our own modules, we must explore what NumPy is and
how to use it. NumPy is a third-party computational Python package that enables us to
perform calculations on lists. NumPy is mainly written in the C language, meaning that it
will be faster than pure Python. In this section, we will have to assess whether our NumPy
implementation beats a Rust implementation that is imported into Python.

Adding vectors in NumPy
NumPy enables us to build vectors that we can loop through and apply functions to.
We can also perform operations between vectors. We can demonstrate the power of
NumPy by adding items of each vector together, as seen here:

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
---------------
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

To achieve this, we initially need to import modules by running the following code:

import time
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

With this, we can build a numpy_function NumPy function that creates two NumPy
vectors of a certain size and adds them together by running the code presented here:

Exploring NumPy      207

def numpy_function(total_vector_size: int) -> float:
    t1 = time.time()
    first_vector = np.arange(total_vector_size)
    second_vector = np.arange(total_vector_size)
    sum_vector = first_vector + second_vector
    return time.time() - t1

Here, we can see that we can add the vectors by merely using the addition operator.
Now that we have our function defined, we can plot how this scales by looping through
a list of integers and applying numpy_function to the items, collecting the results in
a list, by running the code shown here:

numpy_results = [numpy_function(i) for i in range(0 \
  10000)]
plt.plot(numpy_results, linestyle='dashdot')
plt.show()

This gives us a line plot, as shown here:

Figure 7.1 – Time taken to add two NumPy vectors based on size

208     Using Python Modules with Rust

We can see in the preceding screenshot that the increase is linear. This is expected because
there is only one loop when adding each integer in the vector to the other vector. We
can also see that there are points where the time taken shoots up—this is the garbage
collection kicking in. To appreciate the effect NumPy has, we can redefineour example by
adding both vectors with a list in pure Python in the next subsection.

Adding vectors in pure Python
We can add two vectors in pure Python and time this by running the following code:

def python_function(total_vector_size: int) -> float:
    t1 = time.time()
    first_vector = range(total_vector_size)
    second_vector = range(total_vector_size)
    sum_vector = [first_vector[i] + second_vector[i] for \
      i in range(len(second_vector))]
    return time.time() - t1

With our new Python function, we can run both NumPy and Python functions and chart
them by running the following code:

print(python_function(1000))
print(numpy_function(1000))

python_results = [python_function(i) for i in range(0, \
  10000)]
numpy_results = [numpy_function(i) for i in range(0, \
  10000)]

plt.plot(python_results, linestyle='solid')
plt.plot(numpy_results, linestyle='dashdot')
plt.show()

This gives us the following results:

Exploring NumPy      209

Figure 7.2 – Time taken to add two vectors based on size

As we can see in Figure 7.2, the NumPy vectors are represented in the bottom line
and pure Python is represented in the increasing line, so we can conclude that Python
does not scale that well when compared to our NumPy implementation. The output
makes it clear that NumPy is a good choice when performing calculations on big vectors.
However, how does this compare to our Rust implementation? We explore this in the
next subsection.

Adding vectors using NumPy in Rust
To compare how NumPy compares to our Rust implementation, we must incorporate an
adding vector function to our Rust package that we have been building throughout this
book so far. Here are the steps we need to take:

1.  Considering that this is a test function that we are using for demonstrative
purposes, we can merely insert it into our lib.rs file. All we do is build
a time_add_vectors function that accepts a number, create two vectors
of a size equal to the number passed as input, loop through them at the same time,
and add the items together, as shown here:

#[pyfunction]
fn time_add_vectors(total_vector_size: i32)

210     Using Python Modules with Rust

    -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut buffer: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
    let first_vector: Vec<i32> =
      (0..total_vector_size.clone()
         ).map(|x| x).collect();
    let second_vector: Vec<i32> = \
      (0..total_vector_size
         ).map(|x| x).collect();

    for i in &first_vector {
        buffer.push(first_vector[**&i as usize] +
                     second_vector[*i as usize]);
    }
   return buffer
}

2.  Once we have done this, we must remember to add this function to our module,

as follows:

#[pymodule]
fn flitton_fib_rs(_py: Python, m: &PyModule) -> \
  PyResult<()> {
    . . .
    m.add_wrapped(wrap_pyfunction!(time_add_vectors));
    . . .
    Ok(())
}

We must remember to update our GitHub repository and reinstall our Rust package
in our Python environment.

3.  Once this is done, we must implement the function in our Python testing script and

time it. First, we must import it with the code shown here:

import time
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from flitton_fib_rs import time_add_vectors

4.  Once this is done, we can define our rust_function Python function that calls
the time_add_vectors function and times how long it takes to complete the
addition by running the following code:

Exploring NumPy      211

def rust_function(total_vector_size: int) -> float:
    t1 = time.time()
    sum_vector = time_add_vectors(total_vector_size)
    result = time.time() - t1
    if result > 0.00001:
        result = 0.00001
    return result

You may have noticed that we trim result returned by rust_function. This
is not cheating—we do this because when the garbage collector kicks in, it can
cause spikes and ruin the scaling of the graph. We will also do this with our NumPy
function by running the following code:

def numpy_function(total_vector_size: int) -> float:
    t1 = time.time()
    first_vector = np.arange(total_vector_size)
    second_vector = np.arange(total_vector_size)
    sum_vector = first_vector + second_vector
    result = time.time() - t1
    if result > 0.00001:
        result = 0.00001
    return result

We can see that we are applying the same metrics to both the functions so that one
will not be artificially lowered compared to the other.

5.  Now that we have done this, we need to define the pure function by running the

following code:

def python_function(total_vector_size: int) -> float:
    t1 = time.time()
    first_vector = range(total_vector_size)
    second_vector = range(total_vector_size)
    sum_vector = [first_vector[i] + second_vector[i] for
      i in range(len(second_vector))]
    result = time.time() - t1
    if result > 0.0001:

212     Using Python Modules with Rust

        result = 0.0001
    return result

It must be noted that we have a higher cut-off for the pure Python because
we expect the base reading to be much higher.

6.  Now that we have all of our metric functions for Rust, NumPy, and pure Python,
we can create Python lists with the results of both functions and plot them by
running the following code:

numpy_results = [numpy_function(i) for i in range(0, \
  300)]
rust_results = [rust_function(i) for i in range(0, \
  300)]
python_results = [python_function(i) for i in range \
  (0,300)]

plt.plot(rust_results, linestyle='solid', \
  color="green")
plt.plot(python_results, linestyle='solid', \
 color="red")
plt.plot(numpy_results, linestyle='solid', \
color="blue")
plt.show()

Running our code will give us the result shown here:

Figure 7.3 – Time taken to add two vectors based on the size of the vectors;
left: NumPy; middle: Rust; right: pure Python

Building a model in NumPy      213

In the preceding screenshot, we can see that NumPy is the fastest and is not scaling
aggressively as the size of the vector increases. Our Rust implementation is a lot faster
than our pure Python implementation by an order of magnitude, but it is not as efficient
as NumPy.

We can see that Python optimizations such as NumPy do increase the speed compared
to pure Python and Rust. However, NumPy's clean syntax of simply adding vectors is not
the only functional advantage of this module. In the next section, we will explore another
functionality that NumPy has that would require a lot of extra code if we were going to try
to code it from scratch in Python or Rust.

Building a model in NumPy
In this section, we are going to build a basic mathematical model to demonstrate the
power that NumPy has apart from speed. We are going to use matrices to make a simple
model. To achieve this, we will have to carry out the following steps:

1.  Define our model.

2.  Build a Python object that executes our model.

Let's look at these steps in detail in the following subsections.

Defining our model
A mathematical model is essentially a set of weights that calculate an outcome based
on inputs. Before we go any further, we must remember the scope of this book. We are
building a model to demonstrate how to utilize NumPy. If we covered the nuances of
mathematical modeling, that would take up the whole book. We will be building a model
based on the example discussed in the previous section, but this does not mean that the
model defined is an accurate description of the complexity of mathematical modeling.
Here are the steps we need to take:

1.  We start by looking at a very simple mathematical model that would be a simple

speed equation, as shown here:

𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 =

𝑠𝑠𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠

214     Using Python Modules with Rust

2.  With our model, we can calculate the time taken to complete a journey with the

rearrangement shown here:

𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 =

  → 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 =

𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡  → 𝑡𝑡 =  𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼

The final equation on the right is merely substituting the values for letters so that
they can be plugged into a bigger model without it taking up an entire page.

𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡
𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑑𝑑

1
𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑑𝑑

3.  Now, let's take our model a little further. We collect some data from a trucking

company, and we manage to quantify different grades of traffic into numbers and fit
our data so that we can produce a weight to describe the effect traffic has on time.
With this, our model has evolved to the one defined here:

  is the weight of traffic, and y is the grade of traffic. As we can see, if the

Here,
grade of traffic increases, so does the time. Now, let's say that the model is different
for cars and trucks. This gives us the following set of equations:

𝑡𝑡 =  𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼 +  𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽

𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐𝑥𝑥 +   𝛽𝛽𝑐𝑐𝑦𝑦 =   𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐

𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡𝑥𝑥 +   𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡𝑦𝑦 =   𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡
We can deduce from the equations that the distance (x) and traffic grade (y) are
the same for both cars and trucks. This makes sense. While the weights could be
different as cars could be affected by distance and traffic differently, as denoted in
their weights, the input parameters are the same.

4.  Considering this, the equation could be defined as the following matrix equation:

𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 𝛽𝛽𝑐𝑐
𝑥𝑥
𝑦𝑦] = [
𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡] [
[
This might seem excessive right now, but there are advantages to this. Matrices
have a range of functions that enable us to perform algebra on them. We will cover
a few here so that we can understand how NumPy becomes invaluable to us when
calculating this model.

𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐
𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡]

5.  To do this, we must acknowledge that matrix multiplication must occur in a certain
order for it to work. Our model is essentially calculated by the notation shown here:

Building a model in NumPy      215

𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐𝑥𝑥 𝛽𝛽𝑐𝑐𝑦𝑦
𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 𝛽𝛽𝑐𝑐
𝑥𝑥
𝑦𝑦] = [
𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡] [
[
𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡𝑥𝑥 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡𝑦𝑦
6.  Our x y matrix must be on the right of our weights matrix. We can add more inputs
to our x y matrix with the following notation:

𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐𝑥𝑥 + 𝛽𝛽𝑐𝑐𝑦𝑦
𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡𝑥𝑥 + 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡𝑦𝑦

] = [

]

7.  We can, in fact, keep stacking our inputs, and we will get proportional outputs. This

𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 𝛽𝛽𝑐𝑐
𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡] [
[

𝑥𝑥1 𝑥𝑥2 𝑥𝑥3
𝑦𝑦1 𝑦𝑦2 𝑦𝑦3] = [

𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐1
𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡1

𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐2
𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡2

𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐3
𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡3]

is powerful; we can put in an input matrix of any size if we keep the dimensions of
the matrix consistent. We can also invert our matrix. If we invert our matrix, we can
then input times to work out the distance and grade of the traffic. Inverting a matrix
takes the following form:

−1

]

=

𝑎𝑎 𝑏𝑏
[
𝑐𝑐 𝑑𝑑

𝑑𝑑 −𝑏𝑏
[
𝑎𝑎
−𝑐𝑐
8.  Here, we can see that if we multiply a scalar by the matrix, it just gets applied to all
elements of the matrix. Considering this, our model can calculate the traffic grade
and distance using the inverse matrix with the following notation:

] =   [

]

1
𝑎𝑎𝑑𝑑 − 𝑏𝑏𝑐𝑐

𝑑𝑑
𝑎𝑎𝑑𝑑 − 𝑏𝑏𝑐𝑐
−𝑐𝑐
𝑎𝑎𝑑𝑑 − 𝑏𝑏𝑐𝑐

−𝑏𝑏
𝑎𝑎𝑑𝑑 − 𝑏𝑏𝑐𝑐
𝑎𝑎
𝑎𝑎𝑑𝑑 − 𝑏𝑏𝑐𝑐

−1

𝑥𝑥
𝑦𝑦]

𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 𝛽𝛽𝑐𝑐
𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡]
[

𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐
𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡] = [
[
We have only covered enough matrix mathematics to code our model, but even
with just this, we can see that matrices enable us to manipulate multiple equations
and shuffle them around to calculate different things quickly. However, if we were
to code the matrix multiplications from scratch, it would take a lot of time and
we would run the risk of performing errors. To have fast, safe development of our
model, we will need to use NumPy module functions, which is what we will do in
the next subsection.

216     Using Python Modules with Rust

Building a Python object that executes our model
We saw in the previous section that there are two different paths that we can take. When
we build our model, we are going to have two branches—one for calculating the time
taken, and the other for calculating the traffic and distance from time. To build our model
class, we must map out our dependencies, as shown here:

Figure 7.4 – Dependencies of a Python matrix model

The preceding diagram shows us that we must define the weight matrix property before
anything else as this property is the main mechanism on which everything else is
calculated. This was also evident in the matrix equation. We can build our class with the
weight matrix property, as follows:

import numpy as np

class MatrixModel:

    @property
    def weights_matrix(self) -> np.array:
        return np.array([
            [3, 2],
            [1, 4]
        ])

Building a model in NumPy      217

Here, we can see that we use NumPy for our matrix and that our matrix is a list of lists.
We use NumPy arrays over normal arrays because NumPy arrays have matrix operations
such as transpose. Remember that the positions of the matrices matter when they are
being multiplied. For instance, we have a simple matrix equation as follows:

𝐴𝐴 ∙ 𝐵𝐵 = [2 4] [

6
If we were to swap the matrix order, the matrices would not be able to multiply due
8
to their shapes not being compatible; this is where the transpose operation comes
in. A transpose function flips the matrix, enabling us to switch the order of the
multiplication. We will not be using transpose in our model, but the Python
commands in the terminal here show us how NumPy gives us this function out of the box:

] = [2 × 6 4 × 8] = 44

>>> import numpy as np
>>> t = np.array([
                [3, 2],
                [1, 4]
            ])
>>> t.transpose()
array([[3, 1],
       [2, 4]])
>>> x = np.array([
                    [3],
                    [1]
                ])
>>> x.transpose()
array([[3, 1]])

Here, we can see that the matrices that we have built with NumPy arrays can change shape
with ease. Now that we have established that we are building our matrices with NumPy
arrays, we can build a function that will call the function that accepts the distance of the
journey and the traffic grade for our MatrixModel class, as follows:

    def calculate_times(self, distance: int, \
      traffic_grade: int) -> dict:
        inputs = np.array([
            [distance],
            [traffic_grade]
        ])

218     Using Python Modules with Rust

        result = np.dot(self.weights_matrix, inputs)
        return {
            "car time": result[0][0],
            "truck time": result[1][0]
        }

Here, we can see that once we have constructed our input matrix, we multiply this by our
weights matrix with the np.dot function. result is a matrix, which—as we know—is a
list of lists. We unpack this and then return it in the form of a dictionary.

We have nearly finished our model; all we must do now is now build our inverse model.
This is where we pass in the times taken for the journey to calculate the distance and
traffic grade for our MatrixModel class. This is done with the following code:

    def calculate_parameters(self, car_time: int,
                             truck_time: int) -> dict:
        inputs = np.array([
            [car_time],
            [truck_time]
        ])
        result = np.dot(np.linalg.inv(self. \
          weights_matrix), inputs)
        return {
            "distance": result[0][0],
            "traffic grade": result[1][0]
        }

Here, we can see that we take the same approach; however, we use the np.linalg.inv
function to get the inverse of the self.weights_matrix matrix. Now that this
is done, we have a fully functioning model and we can test it, as follows:

test = MatrixModel()

times = test.calculate_times(distance=10, traffic_grade=3)
print(f"here are the times: {times}")

parameters = test.calculate_parameters(
    car_time=times["car time"], truck_time=times["truck \
      time"]

Using NumPy and other Python modules  in Rust     219

)
print(f"here are the parameters: {parameters}")

Running the preceding code will give us the following printout in the terminal:

{'car time': 36, 'truck time': 22}
{'distance': 10.0, 'traffic grade': 3.0}

With this terminal printout, we can see that our model works and that our inverse model
returns the original inputs. With this, we can also conclude that NumPy is more than
just speeding up our code; it gives us extra tools to solve problems such as modeling with
matrices. This is the last hurdle that could stop us from reaching for Rust. In the next
section, we will use the NumPy Python module in Rust by recreating our model in Rust.

Using NumPy and other Python modules
in Rust
In this section, we are going to understand the basics of importing a Python module such
as NumPy in our Rust program and return the result to our Python function. We will
build our functionality in our Fibonacci number package that we have been coding so far
in this book. We will also briefly explore importing a Python module in a generic sense so
that you experience how to use a Python module that has the functionality you are relying
on. We will build a more comprehensive approach to using Python modules in our Rust
code in the next section. For this section, we will write all our code in the src/lib.rs
file. Here are the steps we need to take:

1.  First, we need to acknowledge that we pass in a dictionary and return the results

in it. Because of this, we must import the PyDict struct by running the
following code:

use pyo3::types::PyDict;

2.  Now that this is imported, we can define our function by running the following code:

#[pyfunction]
fn test_numpy<'a>(result_dict: &'a PyDict)
            -> PyResult<&'a PyDict> {
    let gil = Python::acquire_gil();
    let py = gil.python();
    let locals = PyDict::new(py);
    locals.set_item("np",

220     Using Python Modules with Rust

      py.import("numpy").unwrap());
}

Because we are using a Python module, there is no surprise that we acquire the
global interpreter lock (GIL) and get Python to interact with Python objects inside
our Rust code. It must be noted that we also create a PyDict struct called locals.

We then import the NumPy module using the py.import function, inserting
it into our localsstruct.

As demonstrated here, we will be using our locals struct as Python storage:

Figure 7.5 – Rust flow for computing Python processes within Rust

Here, every time we run a Python operation in our Rust code, we will pass Python
objects from the locals into the Python computation. We then pass any new
Python variables we need to add to our PyDict locals struct.

3.  Now that we understand the flow, we can compute our first Python computation

inside our test_numpy function by running the following code:

    let code = "np.array([[3, 2], [1, 4]])";
    let weights_matrix = py.eval(code,
                           None,
                           Some(&locals)).unwrap();
    locals.set_item("weights_matrix", weights_matrix);

Using NumPy and other Python modules in Rust      221

Here, we can see that we define the Python command as a string literal. We then
pass this into our py.eval function. Our None parameter is for global variables.
We are going to refrain from passing in global variables to keep this simple. We also
pass in our PyDict locals struct to get the NumPy module we imported under
the np namespace. We then unwrap the result and add this to our localsstruct.

4.  We can now create an input NumPy vector and insert the outcome into our

localsstruct by running the following code:

    let new_code = "np.array([[10], [20]])";
    let input_matrix = py.eval(new_code, None,
                              Some(&locals)).unwrap();
    locals.set_item("input_matrix", input_matrix);

5.  Now that we have both of our matricies in our locals storage, we can multiply

them together, add them to our input dictionary, and return the result by running
the following code:

    let calc_code = "np.dot(weights_matrix, \
       input_matrix)";
    let result_end = py.eval(calc_code, None,
                             Some(&locals)).unwrap();
    result_dict.set_item("numpy result", result_end);
    return Ok(result_dict)

With this, we can now use NumPy in our Rust code and get the results to pass them back
into the Python system. We must remember to update our GitHub repository and reinstall
our Rust package in our Python system. To test this, we can carry out the following
console commands:

>>> from flitton_fib_rs import test_numpy
>>> outcome = test_numpy({})
>>> outcome["numpy result"].transpose()
array([[70, 90]])

Here, we can see that our NumPy process works inside Rust and returns Python objects
that we can use just like all other Python objects. We could have done this using the Rust
NumPy module, which gives us NumPy Rust structs. However, with the approach that
we have covered, nothing is stopping us from using any Python module that we wish.
We now have a full tool belt for fusing Python with Rust. In the next section, we will
structure our NumPy model in Rust over a range of functions so that we can put in times
for the inverse calculation and grade traffic with distance to calculate the times.

222     Using Python Modules with Rust

Recreating our NumPy model in Rust
Now that we can use our NumPy module in Rust, we need to explore how to structure
it so that we can use Python modules to solve bigger problems. We will do this by building
a NumPy model with a Python interface. To achieve this, we can break down the
processes into functions that can be used as and when we need them. The structure
of our NumPy model can be seen here:

Figure 7.6 – Rust NumPy model structure

Recreating our NumPy model in Rust      223

Considering the flow of our model structure in the preceding diagram, we can build
our NumPy model in Rust with the following steps:

1.  Build get_weight_matrix and inverse_weight_matrix functions.
2.  Build get_parameters, get_times, and get_input_vector functions.
3.  Build calculate_parameters and calculate_times functions.

4.  Add calculate functions to the Python bindings and add a NumPy dependency to

our setup.py file.

5.  Build our Python interface.

We can see that each step has dependencies from the previous step. Let's have a detailed
look at each of these steps in the following subsections.

Building get_weight_matrix and inverse_weight_matrix
functions
Our weight and inverse weight matrices enable us to calculate the times and then
recalculate the parameters inputted based on those times. We can start building our
weight matrix function in the src/numpy_model.rs file with the following steps:

1.  Before we write any code, we can import what we need by running the

following code:

use pyo3::prelude::*;
use pyo3::types::PyDict;

We will be using the PyDict struct to pass data between our functions and pyo3
macros to wrap the functions and get the Python GIL.

2.  Now that we have all of our imports, we can build our weight matrix function by

running the following code:

fn get_weight_matrix(py: &Python, locals: &PyDict) \
  -> () {
    let code: &str = "np.array([[3, 2], [1, 4]])";
    let weights_matrix = py.eval(code, None,
                         Some(&locals)).unwrap();
    locals.set_item("weights_matrix", weights_matrix);
}

224     Using Python Modules with Rust

Here, we can see that we accept a reference to Python and locals storage.
With this, we run our code and add it to our locals storage. We do not have to
return anything because these are just referencing via borrowing. This means that
the py and locals variables are not deleted when the scope of the variable has
run its course. It also means that the locals storage will be updated with our
weights_matrix function even though nothing is returned. We will be using
this approach in most of our functions shown in Figure 7.6.

3.  Now that we have our approach defined, we can create our inverse matrix function

by running the following code:

fn invert_get_weight_matrix(py: &Python,
                            locals: &PyDict) -> () {
    let code: &str = "np.linalg.inv(weights_matrix)";
    let inverted_weights_matrix = py.eval(code, None,
                              Some(&locals)).unwrap();
    locals.set_item("inverted_weights_matrix",
                    inverted_weights_matrix);
}

Clearly, the invert_get_weight_matrix function cannot be run unless we run
our get_weight_matrix function beforehand. We could make this more robust
with a get_item check for weights_matrix in our locals storage and run the
get_weight_matrix function if the weights matrix is not there, but this is not
essential. We now have our weights functions defined, so we can move on to our next
step of building our input vectors and calculation functions.

Building get_parameters, get_times, and get_input_
vector functions
Just as with the previous steps. we are going to get our parameters, times, and inputs by
using three functions. We will also have to pass the Python struct and locals storage
into these functions as they are also going to be using NumPy via Python. We define these
three functions in the following steps:

1.  Referring to Figure 7.6, we can see that our input vector function does not have any
dependencies and the other two depend on the input vector. Considering this,
we build our input vector function by running the following code:

fn get_input_vector(py: &Python, locals: &PyDict,
                    first: i32, second: i32) -> () {

Recreating our NumPy model in Rust      225

    let code: String = format!("np.array([[{}], \
      [{}]])", first, second);
    let input_vector = py.eval(&code.as_str(), None,
                       Some(&locals)).unwrap();
    locals.set_item("input_vector", input_vector);
}

Here, we can see that this vector is generic, so we can pass in the parameters
or the times depending on the calculation that we need. We can see that we use the
format! macro to pass our parameters into our Python code.

2.  Now that our input vector function is defined, we can build our calculations by

running the following code:

fn get_times<'a>(py: &'a Python,
                 locals: &PyDict) -> &'a PyAny {
    let code: &str = "np.dot(weights_matrix, \
      input_vector)";
    let times = py.eval(code, None,
      Some(&locals)).unwrap();
    return times
}

fn get_parameters<'a>(py: &'a Python,
                     locals: &PyDict) -> &'a PyAny {
    let code: &str = "
    np.dot(inverted_weights_matrix, input_vector)";
    let parameters = py.eval(code, None,
                     Some(&locals)).unwrap();
    return parameters
}

With the aforementioned functions, we can get the variables that we need and put them
into our Python code that uses the NumPy np.dot function. We then return the result as
opposed to adding it to locals. We do not need to add it to locals because we are not
going to use the results in any other computations in Rust. Now that all the computation
steps have been done, we can move on to our next step—building the calculation
functions that run and organize the whole process.

226     Using Python Modules with Rust

Building calculate_parameters and calculate_times
functions
With these calculation functions, we need to take in some parameters, get the Python GIL,
define our locals storage, and then run a series of computation processes to get what
we need. We can define a calculate_times function by running the following code:

#[pyfunction]
pub fn calculate_times<'a>(result_dict: &'a PyDict,
    distance: i32, traffic_grade: i32) -> PyResult<&'a \
      PyDict> {
    let gil = Python::acquire_gil();
    let py = gil.python();
    let locals = PyDict::new(py);
    locals.set_item("np", py.import("numpy").unwrap());

    get_weight_matrix(&py, locals);
    get_input_vector(&py, locals, distance, traffic_grade);
    result_dict.set_item("times", get_times(&py, locals));
    return Ok(result_dict)
}

Here, we can see that we get the weight matrix, then the input vector, and then insert
the results into a blank PyDict struct and return it. We can see the flexibility in this
approach. We can slot functions in and out whenever we want, and rearranging the order
is not a struggle. Now that we have built our calculate_times function, we can build
our calculate_parameters function by running the following code:

#[pyfunction]
pub fn calculate_parameters<'a>(result_dict: &'a PyDict,
    car_time: i32, truck_time: i32) -> PyResult<&'a PyDict> {
    let gil = Python::acquire_gil();
    let py = gil.python();
    let locals = PyDict::new(py);
    locals.set_item("np", py.import("numpy").unwrap());

    get_weight_matrix(&py, locals);
    invert_get_weight_matrix(&py, locals);
    get_input_vector(&py, locals, car_time, truck_time);

Recreating our NumPy model in Rust      227

    result_dict.set_item("parameters",
        get_parameters(&py, locals));
    return Ok(result_dict)
}

We can see that we use the same approach as our calculate_times function, using
the invert weights instead. We could refactor this to reduce the repeated code, or we could
enjoy the maximum flexibility of having the two functions isolated against each other.
Our model is built now, so we can move to our next step where we add our calculation
functions to our Python bindings.

Adding calculate functions to the Python bindings and
adding a NumPy dependency to our setup.py file
Now that we have all the model code needed to calculate parameters through two
functions, we are going to have to enable our outside user to utilize these functions with
the following steps:

1.

In our src/lib.rs file, we must define our module by running the following code:

mod numpy_model;

2.  Now that this module has been declared, we can import the functions by running

the following code:

use numpy_model::__pyo3_get_function_calculate_times;
use numpy_model::__pyo3_get_function_calculate_ \
  parameters;

3.  We then wrap our functions in our module by running the following code:

#[pymodule]
fn flitton_fib_rs(_py: Python, m: &PyModule) -> \
  PyResult<()> {
    . . .
    m.add_wrapped(wrap_pyfunction!(calculate_times));
    m.add_wrapped(wrap_pyfunction!(calculate_
parameters));
    . . .
}

228     Using Python Modules with Rust

Remember—. . . denotes existing code. We now must accept that our Rust code
has a dependency on NumPy, so in our setup.py file, our dependencies will look
like this:

    requirements=[
        "pyyaml>=3.13",
        "numpy"
    ]

At this point, there is nothing stopping us from using our NumPy model; however,
it will be better with a simple Python interface, which we will define in the next step.

Building our Python interface
In the src/numpy_model.rs file, we import what we need and define a basic class
by running the following code:

from .flitton_fib_rs import calculate_times, \
calculate_parameters

class NumpyInterface:

    def __init__(self):
        self.inventory = {}

The self.inventory variable will be where we store the results. Our functions for our
class should calculate the times and parameters by calling our Rust functions, as follows:

    def calc_times(self, distance, traffic_grade):
        result = calculate_times({}, distance,
                                 traffic_grade)
        self.inventory["car time"] = result["times"][0][0]
        self.inventory["truck time"] = \
          result["times"][1][0]

    def calc_parameters(self, car_time, truck_time):
        result = calculate_parameters({}, car_time,
            truck_time)
        self.inventory["distance"] =
                          result["parameters"][0][0]

Summary     229

        self.inventory["traffic grade"] =
                          result["parameters"][1][0]

Now that our Python interface is built, we have finished our NumPy model.

We must remember to update our GitHub repository and reinstall our module. Once this
is done, we can run the following Python console commands:

>>> from flitton_fib_rs.numpy_interface import
NumpyInterface
>>> test = NumpyInterface()
>>> test.calc_times(10, 20)
>>> test.calc_parameters(70, 90)
>>> test.inventory
{'car time': 70, 'truck time': 90,
 'distance': 9.999999999999998,
 'traffic grade': 20.0}

While this demonstrates how we can use Python modules within Rust, we have to be
careful when to use them. For our NumPy model example, it would have just been better
to use NumPy within our Python code. To be honest, there is not that much that you can
do with Python modules that you cannot do in Rust. Rust already has a NumPy crate
that we can use. We should be using the Python modules in the initial stage if we cannot
find—or do not have time to find and learn—a Rust alternative module; however, over
time, these should be phased out of your Rust code.

Summary
In this chapter, we completed our tool belt when it comes to building Python extensions
in Rust by using Python modules in our Rust code. We got a deeper appreciation
for modules such as NumPy by exploring matrix mathematics to create a simple
mathematical model. This showed us that we use modules such as NumPy for other
functionality such as matrix multiplication, as opposed to just using NumPy for speed.
This was demonstrated when we manipulated multiple mathematical equations with
a few lines of NumPy code and matrix logic.

230     Using Python Modules with Rust

We then used matrix NumPy multiplication functions in our Rust code to recreate
our mathematical model using a flexible functional programming approach. We finished
this off by making our interface in a Python class. We also must remember that the
NumPy implementation was faster than our Rust code. This is partly down to poor
implementation on our part and the C optimization in NumPy. This has shown us that
while Rust is a lot faster than Python, solving problems with Python packages such as
NumPy might still be faster until equivalent crates are coded in Rust.

We used a generic approach to using Python modules in Rust. Because of this, we can
theoretically use any Python module that we want. This means that if the Python module
that you are rewriting relies on the functionality of third-party Python modules such as
NumPy, we are now able to create Rust functions that use them. Considering this, there is
no generic technical hurdle stopping you from rewriting Python code in Rust and slotting
it into your Python system.

In the next chapter, we will put everything that we have learned so far together to build
a new Python package written in Rust from start to end.

Questions

1.  What are the steps we must follow to run a Python module in Rust?

2.  How do you import a Python module into your Rust code?

3.

If we wanted to use our Python code result inside Rust, how would we do this?

4.  When you compare speed graphs of Python/NumPy with Rust, the Python/NumPy

code has a lot of spikes. What could be causing this?

5.  Do you think our NumPy implementation in Rust will be slower or faster than

calling NumPy from Python, and why?

Answers     231

Answers

1.  We initially must get Python from the GIL. We then must build a PyDict struct
in order to store and pass Python variables between Python executions. We then
define the Python code as a string literal and pass this into our py.eval function
with our PyDict storage.

2.  We must make sure that we get Python from the GIL. We then use this to run the
py.eval function with the import line of code passed in as a string literal.
We must remember to pass in our PyDict storage to ensure that we can reference
the module in the future.

3.  We must remember that Python code returns a PyAny struct, which we can extract

using the following code:

let code = "5 + 6";
let result = py.eval(code, None, Some(&locals)).unwrap();
let number = result.extract::<i32>().unwrap();

We can see that number should be 11.

4.  This is because the Python versions must keep stopping to clean up variables

with the garbage collection mechanism.

5.

It would be slightly slower. This is because we are essentially still running Python
code but through an extra layer which is Rust.Considering this, we should be using
Python code out of convenience as opposed
to optimization.

Structuring an
End-to-End Python
Package in Rust

Now that we have covered enough Rust and pyo3 to theoretically build a range of
real-world solutions, we must be careful. It would not be good if we decided to reinvent
the wheel in Rust and ended up with a slower outcome after coding the solution. Hence,
understanding how to solve a problem and testing our implementation is important.
In this chapter, we will be building a Python package using Rust that solves a simplified
real-world problem and loads data from files to build a catastrophe model. We will
structure the package in a manner where we can slot in extra functionality if our
model gets more complex. Once we build our model, we will test it to see whether our
implementation is worth it in terms of scaling and speed.

234     Structuring an End-to-End Python Package in Rust

In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

•  Breaking down a catastrophe modeling problem for our package

•  Building an end-to-end solution as a package

•  Utilizing and testing our package

This chapter enables us to take what we have learned throughout the book and solve
a real-world problem and handle data files. Testing our solution will also enable us to
avoid spending too much time on a solution that will have a slower result, preventing
us from potentially missing our shot at implementing Rust in Python systems at our
place of work.

chapter_eight.

Breaking down a catastrophe modeling
problem for our package
The project that we are going to build is a catastrophe model. This is where we calculate
the probability of a catastrophe such as a hurricane, flood, or terror attack happening
in a particular geographical location. We could do this using longitude and latitude
coordinates. However, if we are going to do this, it is going to take a lot of computational
power and time with little benefit. For instance, if we were going to calculate the
probability of the flooding at Charing Cross Hospital in London, we could use the
coordinates 51.4869° N, 0.2195° W.

However, if we use the coordinates 51.4865° N, 0.2190° W, we would still be hitting
Charing Cross Hospital, despite us changing the coordinates by 0.0004° N, 0.0005° W.
We could change the coordinates even more and we would still be hitting Charing Cross
Hospital. Therefore, we would be doing loads of computations to calculate repeatedly the
probability of flooding of the same building, which is not efficient. To combat this, we can
break down the locations into bins and give them a numerical value, as shown here:

Breaking down a catastrophe modeling problem for our package     235

Figure 8.1 – Geographical bins for a catastrophe model of an island

Here, we can see that if a line of data in our model referred to bin 25, this means that the
line of data is referring to land in the middle of our island that we are concerned with. We
can make our calculations even more efficient. For instance, we can see that the squares
in Figure 8.1 with the coordinates of 33, 35, 47, and 49 and 1, 2, 8, and 9 are in the sea.
Therefore, the probability of flooding in these squares is zero because it is already water,
and there is nothing that we care about in terms of flooding in the sea. Because we are
merely mapping our calculations onto these bins, nothing is stopping us from redefining
all of the bins inside these squares as one bin.

Therefore, we must perform only one operation to calculate the risk of flooding in all
our sea bins and that would be zero because the sea is already flooded. In fact, nothing
is stopping us from sticking to square classifications for one bin. Bin number 1 could be
all the squares that are 100% inside the sea, saving us a lot of time. We can also go the
other way. We can make some of our bins more refined. For instance, areas near the coast
might have more nuanced gradients of flooding, as a small distance closer to the sea could
greatly increase the risk of flooding; therefore, we could break bin number 26 down into
smaller bins. To avoid being dragged into the weeds, we will just refer to arbitrary bin
numbers in our model data. Catastrophe modeling is its own subject, and we are merely
using it to show how to build Rust Python packages that can solve real problems as
opposed to trying to build the most accurate catastrophe model. Now that we understand
how we map geographical data with probabilities, we can move on to the calculation of
those probabilities.

236     Structuring an End-to-End Python Package in Rust

Like with the mapping of geographical data, probability calculations are more complex
and nuanced than what we are going to cover in this book. Companies like OASISLMF
work with academic departments at universities to model risks of catastrophes and
the damage inflicted. However, there is an overarching theme that we must do when
calculating these probabilities. We will have to calculate the total probability of damage
using the probability of the event happening in the area, and the probability of the event
causing damage. To do this, we must multiply these probabilities together. We also must
break down the probability of the event happening at a certain intensity. For instance, a
category one hurricane is less likely to cause damage to a building compared to a category
five hurricane. Therefore, we are going to run these probability calculations for each
intensity bin.

We cannot go any further in designing our process without looking at the data that
we have available. The data is in the form of CSV files and is available in our GitHub
repository stated in the Technical requirements section. The first data file that we can
inspect is the footprint.csv file. This file presents the probability of a catastrophe
with a certain intensity happening in an area:

Here, we can see that we have taken in a series of event IDs. We can merge the
footprint.csv data with the event IDs we passed in. This enables us to map the event
IDs that we passed in with an area, intensity, and probability of it happening.

Now that we have merged our geographical data, we can now look at our damage data in
the vulnerability.csv file:

Looking at this, we can merge the damage data of the intensity bin ID, duplicating
whatever we need. We then must multiply the probabilities to get the total probability.
The flow can be summed up as follows:

Breaking down a catastrophe modeling problem for our package     237

Figure 8.2 – Catastrophe model flow

Considering the data and flow, we can see that we now have events that have an intensity
bin ID, damage bin ID, probability of the event happening in the area, and the probability
of the event causing damage in a certain bin. These can then be passed on to another
stage, which is the process of calculating financial losses. We will stop here, but we must
remember that real-world applications need to adapt for expansion. For instance, there is
interpolation. This is where we use a function to estimate the values across a bin, which is
demonstrated here:

Figure 8.3 – Linear interpolation of a distribution

238     Structuring an End-to-End Python Package in Rust

Here, we can see that if we just use bins, our reading between 2 and 2.9 would be the
same. We know that the distribution is increasing, so we use a simple linear function, and
the value of our reading increases as the reading increases. There are other more complex
functions we can use, but this can increase the accuracy of readings if the bins are too
wide. While we will not be using interpolation in our example, it is a legitimate step that
we might want to slot in later. Considering this, our processes need to be isolated.

There is only one other thing that we must consider when designing our package, which
is the storage of our model data. Our probabilities will be defined by an academic team
that collected and analyzed a range of data sources and specific knowledge. For instance,
damage to buildings requires structural engineering knowledge and knowledge of
hurricanes. While we might expect our teams to update the models in later releases, we do
not want the end user to easily manipulate data. We also do not want to hardcode the data
into our Rust code; therefore, storing CSV files in our package would be useful for this
demonstration. Considering this, our package should take the following structure:

├── Cargo.toml
├── MANIFEST.in
├── README.md
├── flitton_oasis_risk_modelling
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── footprint.csv
│   └── vulnerability.csv
├── src
│   ├── lib.rs
│   ├── main.rs
│   ├── footprint
│   │   ├── mod.rs
│   │   ├── processes.rs
│   │   └── structs.rs
│   └── vulnerabilities
│       ├── mod.rs
│       ├── processes.rs
│       └── structs.rs

Building an end-to-end solution as a package     239

The structure should be familiar to you. In the preceding file structure, we can see
that our merge processes for the probability of the event happening and the damage
are in their own folders. Data structures for the process are housed in the structs.
rs file and functions around the process are defined in the processes.rs file. The
flitton_oasis_risk_modelling folder will house our compiled Rust code;
therefore, our CSV files are also stored there.

We state that we are storing our CSV files in the MANIFEST.in file. Our lib.rs file is
where our interface between our Rust and Python is defined. Now that we have defined
the process for our catastrophe model, we can move on to the next section of building our
end-to-end package.

Building an end-to-end solution as a package
In the previous section, we identified what we needed to do to build our catastrophe
model package. We can achieve it with the following steps:

1.  Build a footprint merging process.

2.  Build a vulnerability and probability merging process.

3.  Build a Python interface in Rust.

4.  Build an interface in Python.

5.  Build package installation instructions.

Before we build anything, we must define our dependencies in our Cargo.toml file with
the following code:

[package]
name = "flitton_oasis_risk_modelling"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Maxwell Flitton <maxwellflitton@gmail.com>"]
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]
csv = "1.1"
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }

[lib]
name = "flitton_oasis_risk_modelling"
crate-type=["rlib", "cdylib"]

240     Structuring an End-to-End Python Package in Rust

[dependencies.pyo3]
version = "0.13.2"
features = ["extension-module"]

Here, we can see that we are using the csv crate to load our data and the serde crate to
serialize the data that we had loaded from the CSV file. With this approach, it is important
that we start by coding the processes first. This enables us to know what we need when
we get to building our interfaces. Considering this, we can start building our footprint
merging process.

Building a footprint merging process
Our footprint merging process is essentially loading our footprint data and merging it
with our input IDs. Once this is done, we then return the data to be fed into another
process. We initially need to build our data structs before we build our processes, as our
processes will need them. We can build our footprint struct in the src/footprint/
structs.rs file with the following code:

use serde::Deserialize;

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Clone)]
pub struct FootPrint {
    pub event_id: i32,
    pub areaperil_id: i32,
    pub intensity_bin_id: i32,
    pub probability: f32
}

Here, we can see that we apply the Deserialize macro to the struct so that when we
load data from the file, it can be directly loaded into our FootPrint struct. We will also
want to clone our struct if similar multiple event IDs are being passed into our package.

Building an end-to-end solution as a package     241

Now that we have our struct, we can build our merging process in our src/
footprint/processes.rs file:

1.  First, we have to define the imports we need with the following code:

use std::error::Error;
use std::fs::File;
use csv;

use super::structs::FootPrint;

We must remember that we did not define our struct in the src/footprint/
mod.rs file, so this will not run yet, but we will define it in time before running
our code.

2.  We can now build a function that will read a footprint from the file with the

following code:

pub fn read_footprint(mut base_path: String) -> \
  Result<Vec<FootPrint>, Box<dyn Error>> {
    base_path.push_str("/footprint.csv");
    let file = File::open(base_path.as_str())?;
    let mut rdr = csv::Reader::from_reader(file);

    let mut buffer = Vec::new();

    for result in rdr.deserialize() {
        let record: FootPrint = result?;
        buffer.push(record);
    }
    Ok(buffer)
}

Here, we can see our function requires the directory where our data file is housed.
We then add the filename to the path, open the file, and pass it through the
from_reader function. We then define an empty vector and add the data that we
deserialize. We now have a vector of FootPrint structs, which we return.

242     Structuring an End-to-End Python Package in Rust

3.  Now that we have our load data function, we can now build our merge

footprints function in the same file with the following code:

pub fn merge_footprint_with_events(event_ids: \
  Vec<i32>,
      footprints: Vec<FootPrint>) -> Vec<FootPrint> {
    let mut buffer = Vec::new();

    for event_id in event_ids {
        for footprint in &footprints {
            if footprint.event_id == event_id {
                buffer.push(footprint.clone());
            }
        }
    }
    return buffer
}

Here, we can see that we take in a vector of event IDs and a vector of FootPrint
structs. We then loop through our event IDs. For each event, we then loop through
all the FootPrint structs, adding the struct to our buffer if it matches the event
ID. We then return the buffer meaning that we have merged all that we need. We
do not need to code any more processes. To make them useful, we can build an
interface in the src/footprint/mod.rs file.

4.  So, we must import what we need with the following code:

pub mod structs;
pub mod processes;

use structs::FootPrint;
use processes::{merge_footprint_with_events, \
  read_footprint};

5.  Now that we have imported all that we need, we can build our interface in the same

file with the following code:

pub fn merge_event_ids_with_footprint(event_ids: \
  Vec<i32>,
       base_path: String) -> Vec<FootPrint> {

      read_footprint(base_path).unwrap();
    return merge_footprint_with_events(event_ids, \
      foot_prints)
}

Here, we merely accept the file path and event IDs and pass them through our
processes, returning the results.

With this, our footprint processes are built, meaning that we can move on to the next step
of building the vulnerability merge processes.

Building the vulnerability merge process
Now that we have merged our event IDs with our footprint data, we have a working map
of the probabilities of certain events happening at certain intensities within a range of
geographical locations. We can merge this with the probabilities of damage occurring due
to the catastrophe by following these steps:

1.

In this process, we must load the vulnerabilities and then merge them with our
existing data. To facilitate this, we will have to build two structs – one for the data
that is loaded from the file and another for the result after the merge. Because
we are loading the data, we will need to use the serde crate. In our src/
vulnerabilities/structs.rs file, we import it with the following code:

use serde::Deserialize;

2.  We then build our struct to load the file with the following code:

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Clone)]
pub struct Vulnerability {
    pub vulnerability_id: i32,
    pub intensity_bin_id: i32,
    pub damage_bin_id: i32,
    pub probability: f32
}

We must note here that the probability of the data we are loading is labeled under
the probability field. This is the same with our FootPrint struct. Because of
this, we must rename the probability field to avoid clashes during the merge.
We also need to calculate the total probability.

244     Structuring an End-to-End Python Package in Rust

3.  Considering this, our result after the merge takes the form of the following code:

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Clone)]
pub struct VulnerabilityFootPrint {
    pub vulnerability_id: i32,
    pub intensity_bin_id: i32,
    pub damage_bin_id: i32,
    pub damage_probability: f32,
    pub event_id: i32,
    pub areaperil_id: i32,
    pub footprint_probability: f32,
    pub total_probability: f32
}

With this, our structs are complete and we can build our processes in our src/
vulnerabilities/processes.rs file. Here, we are going to have two functions,
reading the vulnerabilities, and then merging them with our model:

1.  First, we must import everything that we need with the following code:

use std::error::Error;
use std::fs::File;
use csv;

use crate::footprint::structs::FootPrint;
use super::structs::{Vulnerability, \
  VulnerabilityFootPrint};

Here, we can see that we are relying on the FootPrint struct from our
footprint module.

2.  Now that we have everything, we can build our first process, which is loading the

data with the following code:

pub fn read_vulnerabilities(mut base_path: String) \
  -> Result<Vec<Vulnerability>, Box<dyn Error>> {
    base_path.push_str("/vulnerability.csv");
    let file = File::open(base_path.as_str())?;
    let mut rdr = csv::Reader::from_reader(file);

    let mut buffer = Vec::new();

Building an end-to-end solution as a package     245

    for result in rdr.deserialize() {
        let record: Vulnerability = result?;
        buffer.push(record);
    }
    Ok(buffer)
}

Here, we can see that this is similar code to our loading process in our footprint
module. Refactoring this into a generalized function would be a good exercise.
3.  Now that we have our loading function, we can merge Vec<Vulnerability>
with Vec<FootPrint> to get Vec<VulnerabilityFootPrint>. We can
define the function with the following code:

pub fn merge_footprint_with_vulnerabilities(
  vulnerabilities: Vec<Vulnerability>,
  footprints: Vec<FootPrint>) -> \
    Vec<VulnerabilityFootPrint> {
    let mut buffer = Vec::new();

    for vulnerability in &vulnerabilities {
        for footprint in &footprints {
            if footprint.intensity_bin_id == \
              vulnerability
                .intensity_bin_id {
                . . .
            }
        }
    }
    return buffer
}

Here, we can see that we have a new vector called buffer, which is where the
merged data will be stored in the . . . placeholder. We can see that we loop
through the footprints for each vulnerability. If intensity_bin_id matches, we
execute the code in the . . . placeholder, which is the following code:

buffer.push(VulnerabilityFootPrint{
    vulnerability_id: vulnerability.vulnerability_id,

246     Structuring an End-to-End Python Package in Rust

    intensity_bin_id: vulnerability.intensity_bin_id,
    damage_bin_id: vulnerability.damage_bin_id,
    damage_probability: vulnerability.probability,
    event_id: footprint.event_id,
    areaperil_id: footprint.areaperil_id,
    footprint_probability: footprint.probability,
    total_probability: footprint.probability * \
      vulnerability.probability
                });

Here, we are merely mapping the correct values to the correct fields of our
VulnerabilityFootPrint struct. In the last field, we calculate the total
probability by multiplying the other probabilities together.

Our processes are finally done, so we move on to building our interface for this process in
our src/vulnerabilities/mod.rs file:

1.  We first import what we need with the following code:

pub mod structs;
pub mod processes;

use structs::VulnerabilityFootPrint;
use processes::{merge_footprint_with_vulnerabilities \
    ,read_vulnerabilities};
use crate::footprint::structs::FootPrint;

With this, we can create a function that takes in a base path for the directory of
where our data files are and our footprint data.

2.  We then pass them through both of our processes, loading and merging, and then

return our merged data with the following code:

pub fn merge_vulnerabilities_with_footprint( \
  footprint: Vec<FootPrint>, mut base_path: String) \
    -> Vec<VulnerabilityFootPrint> {
    let vulnerabilities = read_vulnerabilities( \
      base_path).unwrap();
    return merge_footprint_with_vulnerabilities( \
      vulnerabilities, footprint)
}

Building an end-to-end solution as a package     247

We have now built our two processes for constructing our data model. We can move on to
our next step, which is building our Python interface in Rust.

Building a Python interface in Rust
The Python interface is defined in the src/lib.rs file, where we use the pyo3 crate to
get our Rust code to communicate with the Python system. Here are the steps:

1.  First, we must import what we need with the following code:

use pyo3::prelude::*;
use pyo3::wrap_pyfunction;
use pyo3::types::PyDict;

mod footprint;
mod vulnerabilities;

use footprint::merge_event_ids_with_footprint;
use vulnerabilities::merge_vulnerabilities_with_
footprint;
use vulnerabilities::structs::VulnerabilityFootPrint;

Here, we can see that we import what we need from the pyo3 crate. We will be
wrapping a get_model function with wrap_pyfunction and returning a list of
PyDict structs. We also define the process modules, structs, and functions that we
need to build our model.

2.  We can then define our function with the following code:

#[pyfunction]
fn get_model<'a>(event_ids: Vec<i32>, \
    mut base_path: String, py: Python) -> Vec<&PyDict> {
    let footprints = merge_event_ids_with_footprint( \
      event_ids, base_path.clone());
    let model = merge_vulnerabilities_with_footprint \
      (footprints, base_path);

   let mut buffer = Vec::new();

   for i in model {

248     Structuring an End-to-End Python Package in Rust

       . . .
   }
   return buffer
}

It must be noted that we accept a Python struct into our function. This is
automatically filled. If we get the Python struct via the Global Interpreter Lock
(GIL) as done in previous chapters, we will not be able to return them because
the lifetime will finish at the end of the function. Because we take in the Python
struct, we can return the Python structures that we create in the function using the
Python struct that we took in.
In the . . . placeholder, we create a PyDict struct with all the data for the model
row and push it to our buffer with the following code:

3.

    let placeholder = PyDict::new(py);
    placeholder.set_item("vulnerability_id", \
      i.vulnerability_id);
    placeholder.set_item("intensity_bin_id", \
      i.intensity_bin_id);
    placeholder.set_item("damage_bin_id", \
      i.damage_bin_id);
    placeholder.set_item("damage_probability",\
      i.damage_probability);
    placeholder.set_item("event_id", \
      i.event_id);
    placeholder.set_item("areaperil_id",\
      i.areaperil_id);
    placeholder.set_item("footprint_probability", \
      i.footprint_probability);
    placeholder.set_item("total_probability", \
      i.total_probability);
       buffer.push(placeholder);

Here, we can see that we can push different types to our PyDict struct and Rust
does not care.

4.  We can then wrap our function and define our module with the following code:

Building an end-to-end solution as a package     249

#[pymodule]
fn flitton_oasis_risk_modelling(_py: Python, \
    m: &PyModule) -> PyResult<()> {
    m.add_wrapped(wrap_pyfunction!(get_model));
    Ok(())
}

Now that all our Rust programming is done, we can move on to building our Python
interface in the next step.

Building our interface in Python
When it comes to our Python interface, we will have to build a function in a Python
script in the flitton_oasis_rist_modelling/__init__.py file. We also store
our data CSV files in the flitton_oasis_rist_modelling directory. Remember,
we do not want our users interfering with the CSV files or having to know where they are.
To do this, we will use the os Python module to find the directory of our module to load
our CSV data.

To do this, we import what we need in the flitton_oasis_rist_modelling/__
init__.py file with the following code:

import os
from .flitton_oasis_risk_modelling import *

Remember, our Rust code will compile into a binary and be stored in the flitton_
oasis_rist_modelling directory, so we can do a relative import for all the wrapped
functions in our Rust code. Now, we can code our construct_model model function
with the following code:

def construct_model(event_ids):
    dir_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))
    return get_model(event_ids, str(dir_path))

Here, we can see that all the user needs to do is pass in the event IDs. However, if we tried
to install this package using pip, we would get errors stating that the CSV files cannot be
found; this is because our setup does not include the data files. We can solve this in our
next step of building package installation instructions.

250     Structuring an End-to-End Python Package in Rust

Building package installation instructions
To do this, we must state that we want to keep all CSV files in our MANIFEST.in file with
the following code:

recursive-include flitton_oasis_risk_modelling/*.csv

Now that we have done this, we can move to our setup.py file to define our setup:

1.  First, we must import what we need with the following code:

#!/usr/bin/env python
from setuptools import dist
dist.Distribution().fetch_build_eggs([ \
  'setuptools_rust'])
from setuptools import setup
from setuptools_rust import Binding, RustExtension

Here, as we have done before, we fetch the setuptools_rust package; although
it is not essential for the running of the package, it is needed for the installation.

2.  We can now define our setup parameters with the following code:

setup(
    name="flitton-oasis-risk-modelling",
    version="0.1",
    rust_extensions=[RustExtension(
    ".flitton_oasis_risk_modelling.flitton_oasis \
      _risk_modelling",
       path="Cargo.toml", binding=Binding.PyO3)],
    packages=["flitton_oasis_risk_modelling"],
    include_package_data=True,
    package_data={'': ['*.csv']},
    zip_safe=False,
)

Here, we can see that we do not need any Python third-party packages. We have
also defined our Rust extension, set the include_package_data parameter to
True, and defined our package data with package_data={'': ['*.csv']}.
With this, all CSV files will be kept when installing our package.

Building an end-to-end solution as a package     251

3.  We are nearly finished; all we have to do is define the rustflags environment

variables in the .cargo/config file with the following code:

[target.x86_64-apple-darwin]
rustflags = [
    "-C", "link-arg=-undefined",
    "-C", "link-arg=dynamic_lookup",
]
[target.aarch64-apple-darwin]
rustflags = [
    "-C", "link-arg=-undefined",
    "-C", "link-arg=dynamic_lookup",
]

With this, we can upload our code and install it in our Python system.

We can now use our Python module. We can test this in our module with the terminal
output, as follows:

>>> from flitton_oasis_risk_modelling import
  construct_model
>>> construct_model([1, 2])
[{'vulnerability_id': 1, 'intensity_bin_id': 1,

. . .

There's more data that is printed out, but if your printout correlates with the preceding
output, then there is a high chance that the rest of your data is accurate. Here, we have
built a real-world solution that loads data and does a series of operations and processes
to come up with a model. However, it is a basic model that would not be used in real-life
catastrophe modeling; we have coded it in isolated modules so that we can slot in more
processes when we need to.

However, we need to ensure that all our effort was not for nothing. We can do what we did
in this package with a few lines of Python code using pandas, which is written in C, so it
could be quicker or at the same speed. Considering this, we need to test to ensure that we
are not wasting our time by testing our code in the next section.

Utilizing and testing our package
We have started building out our solution in a Python package coded in Rust. However,
we need to justify to our team and ourselves that all this effort was worth it. We can test to
see whether we should continue with our efforts in a single isolated Python script. In this
Python script, we can test by following these steps:

1.  Build a Python construct model using pandas.

2.  Build random event ID generator functions.

3.  Time our Python and Rust implementations with a series of different data sizes.

Once we have carried out all the aforementioned steps, we will know whether we should
progress further with our module.

In our testing script, before we start coding anything, we must import all of what we need
with the following code:

import random
import time

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Utilizing and testing our package     253

import pandas as pd
from flitton_oasis_risk_modelling import construct_model

Here, we are using the random module to generate random event IDs and the time
module to time our implementations. We are using pandas to build our model,
matplotlib to plot the outcomes, and our Rust implementation. We can now build
our model.

Building a Python construct model using pandas
Now that we have imported everything that we need, we can move on to loading data
from the CSV files in Python and use it to construct a model in Python using pandas
with the following steps:

1.  First, our function must take in event IDs. We also must load our data from our

CSV files with the following code:

def python_construct_model(event_ids):
    vulnerabilities = \
      pd.read_csv("./vulnerability.csv")
    foot_print = pd.read_csv("./footprint.csv")
    event_ids = pd.DataFrame(event_ids)

2.  Now that we have all our data, we can merge our data and rename the
probability column to avoid clashing with the following code:

    model = pd.merge(
        event_ids, foot_print, how="inner", \
          on="event_id"
    )
    model.rename(
        columns={"probability": \
          "footprint_probability"},
        inplace=True
    )

Here, we can see that we are using less code.

254     Structuring an End-to-End Python Package in Rust

3.  Now, we can do our final process, which is merging with the vulnerabilities and

then calculating the total probability with the following code:

    model = pd.merge(
        model, vulnerabilities,
        how="inner", on="intensity_bin_id"
    )
    model.rename(
        columns={"probability": \
          "vulnerability_probability"},
        inplace=True
    )
    model["total_prob"] = \
      model["footprint_probability"] * \
        model["vulnerability_probability"]
    return model

With this, our Python model is now complete. We can now move on to our next step of
building our random event ID generator functions.

Building a random event ID generator function
When it comes to our Rust implementation, we need a list of integers. For our Python
model, we need to pass in a list of dictionaries with an event ID stored in it. We can define
these functions with the following code:

def generate_event_ids_for_python(number_of_events):
    return [{"event_id": random.randint(1, 4)} for _
            in range(0, number_of_events)]

def generate_event_ids_for_rust(number_of_events):
    return [random.randint(1, 4) for _
            in range(0, number_of_events)]

Now that we have everything we need, we can carry out the final step of testing our
implementations.

Utilizing and testing our package     255

Timing our Python and Rust implementations with a
series of different data sizes
We now have everything we need to test our Rust and Python implementation.
Running both Python and Rust models with timing can be done by carrying out the
following steps:

1.  To test our implementation, we define our entry point and all the data structures for

our time graph with the following code:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    x = []
    python_y = []
    rust_y = []

2.  For our testing data, we are going to loop through a list of integers from 10 to 3000

in steps of 10 with the following code:

    for i in range(10, 3000, 10):
        x.append(i)

Both Python and Rust implementations will be running the same event ID dataset
sizes, which is why we only have one x vector. We can now test our Python
implementation with the following code:
        python_event_ids = \
          generate_event_ids_for_python(
            number_of_events=i
        )
        python_start = time.time()
        python_construct_model(event_ids= \
          python_event_ids)
        python_finish = time.time()
        python_y.append(python_finish - python_start)

Here, we generate our ID dataset to the size of the integer of the loop. We then start
our timer, construct our model in Python, finish the timer, and add the time taken
to our Python data list.

256     Structuring an End-to-End Python Package in Rust

3.  We take the same approach with our Rust test with the following code:

        rust_event_ids = generate_event_ids_for_rust(
            number_of_events=i
        )
        rust_start = time.time()
        construct_model(rust_event_ids)
        rust_finish = time.time()
        rust_y.append(rust_finish - rust_start)

Our data collection is now complete.

4.  All we need to do is plot the results when the loop has finished with the following

code:

    plt.plot(x, python_y)
    plt.plot(x, rust_y)
    plt.show()

We have now written all the code for testing, which should display a graph like this:

Figure 8.4 – Rust versus Python for the time taken for model generation for the size of data

Summary     257

In the preceding figure, we see that initially, our Rust implementation is faster than our
Python pandas implementation. However, once we get past the 1,300 mark, our Rust
model gets slower than our Python pandas model. This is because our code does not scale
well. We are performing loops within loops. In our pandas model, we vectorize our total
probability. pandas is a well-written module where multiple developers have optimized
the merge functions.

Therefore, although our Rust code will be faster than Python and pandas code, if
our implementation is sloppy and does not scale well, we may even be slowing down
our program. I have seen poorly implemented C++ be beaten by Python pandas.
Understanding this nuance is important when trying to implement Rust in your system.
Rust is a new language, and colleagues will be let down if you promise big gains, poorly
implement code, and result in slower performance after burning a lot of time coding
implementation in Rust.

Seeing that this is a book about building Python packages in Rust as opposed to data
processing in Rust, this is where we stop. However, Xavier Tao implemented an efficient
merge process in Rust, resulting in Rust taking 75% less time and 78% less memory. This
is noted in the Further reading section. There is also a Rust implementation of pandas
called Polars, which also has Python bindings. It is faster than standard pandas, and this
documentation is also listed in the Further reading section.

The takeaway message here is that Rust enables us to build fast memory-efficient solutions,
but we must be careful with our implementation and test to see whether what we are
doing is sensible. We should be careful, especially if we are trying to build a solution from
scratch that has an optimized solution in an existing Python package.

Summary
In this chapter, we went through the basics of building a simple catastrophe model.
We then broke down the logic and converted it into steps so that we could build the
catastrophe model in Rust. This included taking in paths, loading data from files,
including data in our package, and building a Python interface so that our users do not
have to know about what is going on under the hood when constructing a model. After
all of this, we tested our module and ensured that we kept increasing the data size of the
test to see how it scales. We saw that, initially, our Rust solution was faster because Rust is
faster than Python and pandas. However, our implementation did not scale well, as we did
a loop within a loop for our merge.

258     Structuring an End-to-End Python Package in Rust

As the data size increased, our Rust code ended up being slower. In previous chapters,
we have shown multiple times that Rust implementations are generally faster. However,
this does not counteract the effects of bad code implementation. If you are relying on a
Python third-party module to perform a complex process, it probably is not a good idea
to rewrite it in Rust for performance gains. If a Rust crate is not available for the same
solution, then it is probably best to leave that part of the solution to the Python module.

In the next chapter, we will be building a Flask web application to lay the groundwork for
applying Rust to a Python web application.

Section 3:
Infusing Rust into a
Web Application

At this point, all the key areas have been covered in terms of using Rust practically in
Python code. In this section, we will apply all of what we have learned thus far in a
practical project. We achieve this by injecting our Python packages written in Rust into
every aspect of a web application that can be deployed in Docker.

This section comprises the following chapters:

•  Chapter 9, Structuring a Python Flask App for Rust

•  Chapter 10, Injecting Rust into a Python Flask App

•  Chapter 11, Best Practices for Integrating Rust

9
Structuring a Python
Flask App for Rust

In the previous chapter, we managed to solve a real-world problem with Rust. However,
we also learned an important lesson, that is, the good implementation of code, such as
adding vectors or merging dataframes, along with third-party modules, such as NumPy,
can outperform badly implemented self-coded Rust solutions. However, we know that
comparing implementation to implementation, Rust is a lot faster than Python. We
already understand how to fuse Rust with a standard Python script. However, Python is
used for more than just running scripts. A popular use for Python is in web applications.

In this chapter, we will build a Flask web application with NGINX, a database, and a
message bus implemented by the Celery package. This message bus will allow our
application to process heavy tasks in the background while we return a web HTTP
request. The web application and message bus will be wrapped in Docker containers
and deployed to docker-compose. However, nothing is preventing us from deploying
the application onto a cloud platform if desired.

In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

•  Building a basic Flask application

•  Defining a database access layer

•  Building a message bus

262     Structuring a Python Flask App for Rust

This chapter will enable us to build a foundation for deployable Python web applications
that have a range of features and services. This foundation allows us to discover how to
fuse Rust with Python web applications that are wrapped in Docker containers.

Technical requirements
The code and data for this chapter can be found at https://github.com/
PacktPublishing/Speed-up-your-Python-with-Rust/tree/main/
chapter_nine.

In addition to this, we will be using docker-compose on top of Docker to orchestrate
our Docker containers. This can be installed by following the instructions at https://
docs.docker.com/compose/install/.

In this chapter, we will be building a Docker-contained Flask application, which is
available via the GitHub repository at https://github.com/maxwellflitton/
fib-flask.

Building a basic Flask application
Before we begin adding any additional features such as a database to an application,
we have to ensure that that we can get a basic Flask application up and running with
everything that we need. This application will take in a number and return a Fibonacci
number. Additionally, we will need to make sure that this application can run in its own
Docker container if we were to deploy it. By the end of this section, our application should
have the following structure:

│   ├── docker-compose.yml
│   └── nginx

Here, you can see that the application is housed in the src directory. When running our
application, we must ensure that the PYTHONPATH path is set to src. The code required
for our deployment exists in the deployment directory. To build an application so that it
can run in Docker, perform the following steps:

1.  Build an entry point for our application.

2.  Build a Fibonacci number calculation module.

3.  Build a Docker image for our application.

4.  Build our NGINX service.

Once we have completed all of these steps, we will have a basic Flask application that
can be run on a server. Now, let's explore each of these steps in detail in the following
subsections.

Building an entry point for our application
Here are the steps to perform:

1.  Before we can build our entry point, we need to install the Flask module using the

following command:

pip install flask

2.  Once this is done, we have all we need to create a basic Flask application by defining

the entry point in the src/app.py file using the following code:

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "home for the fib calculator"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(use_reloader=True, port=5002, \
      threaded=True)

264     Structuring a Python Flask App for Rust

Here, observe that we can define a basic route with the decorator. We can run
our application by running the src/app.py script; this will run our server
locally, enabling us to access all of the routes that we have defined. Passing the
http://127.0.0.1:5002 URL into our browser will give us the following view:

Figure 9.1 – The main view of our local Flask server

Now that our basic server is running, we can move on to build a Fibonacci number
calculator module.

Building our Fibonacci number calculator module
Here are the steps to perform:

1.

In this example, our application is simple. As a result, we can define our module's
functionality within one file in one class. We define it within the src/fib_
calcs/fib_calculation.py file using the following code:

class FibCalculation:

    def __init__(self, input_number: int) -> None:
        self.input_number: int = input_number
        self.fib_number: int = self.recur_fib(
            n=self.input_number
        )
    @staticmethod
    def recur_fib(n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 1:
            return n
        else:
            return (FibCalculation.recur_fib(n - 1) +
                    FibCalculation.recur_fib(n - 2))

Building a basic Flask application     265

Here, notice that our class merely takes in an input number and automatically
populates the self.fib_number attribute with the calculated Fibonacci number.

2.  Once that is done, we can define a view that accepts an integer through the URL,
passes it to our FibCalculation class, and returns the calculated Fibonacci
number as a string to the user in our src/app.py file using the following code:

from fib_calcs.fib_calculation import FibCalculation
. . .

@app.route("/calculate/<int:number>")
def calculate(number):
    calc = FibCalculation(input_number=number)
    return f"you entered {calc.input_number} " \
           f"which has a Fibonacci number of " \
           f"{calc.fib_number}"

3.  Rerunning our server and passing the http://127.0.0.1:5002/
calculate/10 URL into our browser will give us the following view:

Figure 9.2 – Calculating the view of our local Flask server

Now our application performs its intended purpose: it calculates a Fibonacci number
based on the input. There is more to views with Flask; however, this book is not a web
development textbook. If you want to learn how to build more comprehensive API
endpoints, we advise that you look into the Flask API and Marshmallow packages.
References to both are available in the Further reading section. Now, we need to make our
application deployable so that we can use it in a range of settings for our next step.

266     Structuring a Python Flask App for Rust

Building a Docker image for our application
For our application to be usable, we must build a Docker image of our application
that accepts requests. Then, we must protect it with another container call that acts as
an ingress. NGINX performs load balancing, caching, streaming, and the redirecting
of traffic. Our application will be run using the Gunicorn package, which, essentially,
runs multiple workers of our application at the same time. For each request, NGINX
asks which Gunicorn worker the request should go to and redirects it, as shown in the
following diagram:

Figure 9.3 – The flow of requests for our application

We can achieve the layout defined in the preceding diagram by performing the
following steps:

1.  Before we build a Docker image, we must make sure the requirements for our

application are handled. Therefore, we must install Gunicorn using pip with the
following command:

pip install gunicorn

2.  We must make sure that we are in the src directory because we are going to dump
all of our application dependencies into a file called requirements.txt using
the following command:

 pip freeze > requirements.txt

This gives us a text file with a list of all the dependencies that our application needs
in order to run. Right now, all we need is Flask and Gunicorn.

Building a basic Flask application     267

3.  With this, we can start coding our Docker file so that we can build application

images of our application. First, in our src/Dockerfile file, we should define
the operating system that is required with the following code:

FROM python:3.6.13-stretch

This means that our image is running a stripped-down version of Linux with
Python installed.

4.  Now that we have the correct operating system, we should define our app's directory

and copy all of our application files into the image using the following code:

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the
  container at /app
ADD . /app

5.  Now that all of our application files are in the image, we install system updates and
then install the python-dev package. This is so that we can include extensions
with the code given here:

RUN apt-get update -y
RUN apt-get install -y python3-dev python-dev gcc

This will enable us to compile our Rust code in our application and use database
binaries.

Our system has now been set up, so we can move on to install our requirements
using the following code:

RUN pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

Everything is in place to define our system. Nothing is stopping us from running
our application.

6.  To do this, we expose the port and run our application using the following code:

EXPOSE 5002

CMD ["gunicorn", "-w 4", "-b", "0.0.0.0:5002", \
  "app:app"]

268     Structuring a Python Flask App for Rust

Note that when we create a container from the image, we run CMD with the
parameters defined in the list. We state that we have four workers with the
-w 4 parameter. Then, we define the URL and port that we are listening to.
Our final parameter is app:app. This states that our application is housed in
the app.py file, and our application in that file is the Flask object under the
variable name of app.

7.  We can now build our application image using the following command:

docker build . -t flask-fib

The result is a very long stream of console printouts, but essentially, our Docker
image is built with the flask-fib tag.

8.  We can then inspect our images using the following command:

docker image ls

Running this command gives us an image that has been created in the
following form:

REPOSITORY      TAG         IMAGE ID
flask-fib       latest      0cdb0c979ac1
CREATED          SIZE
33 minutes ago   1.05GB

This is important. We will need to reference our image later when we are running our
application with NGINX, which we will define next.

Building our NGINX service
When it comes to Docker and NGINX, we are lucky in that we do not have to build
a Dockerfile that defines our NGINX image. NGINX has released an official image
that we can download and use for free. However, we do have to alter its configuration.
NGINX is fairly important; this is because it gives us the ability to control how incoming
requests are processed. We can redirect the requests to different services depending on
parts of the URL. Additionally, we can control the size of the data, the duration of the
connection, and configure HTTPS traffic. NGINX can also act as a load balancer. In
this example, we are going to configure NGINX in the simplest format to get it running.
However, it must be noted that NGINX is a vast topic in itself; a reference to a useful
NGINX book is provided in the Further reading section.

Building a basic Flask application     269

We can build our NGINX service and connect it to our Flask application by performing
the following steps:

1.  We will configure our NGINX container with what we code in the deployment/
nginx/nginx.conf file. In this file, we declare our worker processes and error
log, as follows:

worker_processes  auto;
error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log warn;

Here, we have defined worker_processes as auto. This is where we
automatically detect the number of CPU cores available, setting the number of
processes to the number of CPU cores.

2.  Now, we have to define the maximum number of connections that a worker can

entertain at a time using the following code:

events {
    worker_connections  512;
}

It must be noted that the number that is chosen here is the default number
for NGINX.

3.  All that is now left for us to do is to define our HTTP listener. This can be achieved

with the following code:

http {
    server {
           listen 80;

           location / {
                proxy_pass http://flask_app:5002/;
           }
    }
}

270     Structuring a Python Flask App for Rust

Here, observe that we listen to port 80, which is the standard outside listening port.
Then, we state that if there is any pattern to our URL, we pass it to our flask_app
container at port 5002. We can stack multiple locations in the http section if we
wish. For instance, if we have another app, we can route the request to the other
application if the URL tail starts with /another_app/ using the following code:

           location /another_app {
                proxy_pass http://another_app:5002/;
           }
           location / {
                proxy_pass http://flask_app:5002/;
           }

Our configuration file for our NGINX is complete. Again, there are many more
configuration parameters; we are just running the bare minimum. More resources on
these parameters are signposted in the Further reading section. Considering that our
NGINX configuration file is complete, for the next step, we have to run it alongside our
Flask application.

Connecting and running our Nginx service
To run our application and NGINX together, we will be using docker-compose. This
allows us to define multiple Docker containers at the same time that can talk to each
other. Nothing is stopping us from running docker-compose on a server to achieve
a basic setup. However, more advanced systems such as Kubernetes can help with the
orchestration of Docker containers across multiple servers if needed. In addition to this,
different cloud platforms offer out-of-the-box load balancers. Perform the following steps:

1.

In our deployment/docker-compose.yml file, we state what version of
docker-compose we are using with the following code:

version: "3.7"

2.  Now that this has been implemented, we can define our services along with our first
service, which is our Flask application. This is defined with the following code:

services:

    flask_app:
        container_name: fib-calculator
        image: "flask-fib:latest"
        restart: always

Building a basic Flask application     271

        ports:
          - "5002:5002"
        expose:
            - 5002

In the preceding code, we reference the image that we built with the latest release.
For instance, if we changed the image and rebuilt it, then our docker-compose
setup would use this. We also give it a container name, so we know the container
status when checking the running containers. Additionally, we state that we accept
traffic through port 5002, and we route it to our container's port 5002. Because we
have chosen this path, we also expose port 5002. If we run our docker-compose
setup now, we could access our application with the http://localhost:5002
URL. However, if this was running on a server and port 5002 was not accessible to
outside traffic, then we would not be able to access it.

3.  Considering this, we can define our NGINX in our deployment/docker-

compose.yml file using the following code:

    nginx:
        container_name: 'nginx'
        image: "nginx:1.13.5"
        ports:
          - "80:80"
        links:
            - flask_app
        depends_on:
            - flask_app
        volumes:
          - ./nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf

272     Structuring a Python Flask App for Rust

Here, you can see that we rely on the third-party NGINX image and that we
route the outside port of 80 to port 80. Also, we link to our Flask application,
and we depend on it, meaning that docker-compose will ensure that our
Flask application is up and running before we run our NGINX service. In the
volumes section, we replace the standard configuration file with the configuration
file that we defined in the previous step. As a result, our NGINX service will run
the configuration that we defined. It must be noted that this configuration switch
will happen every time we run docker-compose. This means that if we change
our configuration file and then run docker-compose again, we will see the
changes. So, we have done everything to get our application up and running.
Now we can test it.

4.  Testing our application is as easy as running the following command:

Docker-compose up

Our services will boot up, and we will get the following printout:

Starting fib-calculator ... done
Starting nginx          ... done
Attaching to fib-calculator, nginx

. . .
nginx        | /docker-entrypoint.sh: Configuration
complete;
ready for start up

Defining our data access layer     273

Here, notice that both of our services spin up without any problems. Our Flask
application starts Gunicorn, starts listening at port 5002, and boots up workers
to process requests. Following this, our NGINX service looks for a range of
configurations before concluding that the configuration is complete and that it is
ready to start up. Also, note that the NGINX started after our Flask application
was started. This is because we stated that our NGINX was dependent on our Flask
application when building our docker-compose file.

Now, we can directly hit our localhost URL without having to specify a port because
we are listening to the outside port of 80 with our NGINX. This gives us results
similar to the following:

Figure 9.4 – Interacting with our fully containerized Flask application

Now we have a fully containerized application that runs. This is at a ready state, so in the
next chapter, we can test to see whether our Rust integration with our application will
actually work in a real-life scenario. Now that we have gotten our application running,
we can move on to build our data access layer. This will allow us to store and get data
from a database.

Defining our data access layer
Now we have an application that takes in a number and calculates a Fibonacci number
based on it. However, a database lookup is quicker than a calculation. We will use this
fact to optimize our application by initially performing a database lookup when a number
is submitted. If it is not there, we calculate the number, store it in the database, and then
return it to the user. Before we start building, we will have to install the following packages
using pip:

•  pyml: This package helps in loading parameters for our application from

a .yml file.

•  sqlalchemy: This package enables our application to map Python objects

to databases for storing and querying.

•  alembic: This package helps in tracking and applying changes to the database

from the application.

•  psycopg2-binary: This is the binary that will enable our application to connect

to the database.

274     Structuring a Python Flask App for Rust

Now that we have installed all that we need, we can enable our application to store and get
Fibonacci numbers by performing the following steps:

1.  Define a PostgreSQL database in docker-compose.

2.  Build a config loading system.

3.  Define a data access layer.

4.  Build database models.

5.  Set up the application database migration system.

6.  Apply the database access layer to the fib calculation view.

Once we have completed these steps, our application will take the following form:

├── deployment
│   . . .
├── docker-compose.yml
├── src
│   . . .
│   ├── config.py
│   ├── config.yml
│   ├── data_access.py
│   ├── fib_calcs
│   │   . . .
│   ├── models
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── database
│   │       ├── __init__.py
│   │       └── fib_entry.py
│   └── requirements.txt

Our deployment file structure has not changed. We have added a docker-compose.
yml file to our root as it will enable us to access the database when we are developing our
application. In addition to this, we have added a data access file to enable us to connect
to the database along with a models module to enable mapping objects to the database.
This structure will result in a containerized Flask application that has access to a database.
Next, we will begin defining our Docker container for our database.

Defining our data access layer     275

Defining a PostgreSQL database in docker-compose
To define our database container, we apply the following code to both the deployment/
docker-compose.yml file and the docker-compose.yml file:

    Postgres:
      container_name: 'fib-dev-Postgres
      image: 'postgres:11.2'
      restart: always
      ports:
        - '5432:5432'
      environment:
        - 'POSTGRES_USER=user'
        - 'POSTGRES_DB=fib'
        - 'POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password'

Here, you can observe that we are relying on the official third-party Postgres image.
Instead of defining a configuration file, as we did with the NGINX service, we define
the password, database name, and user using the environment variables. When we
are running our local environment and developing our application, we will run our
docker-compose file in the root. Now we have defined our database; in the next
section, we can build our config system.

Building a config loading system
Essentially, our configuration system loads parameters from a .yml file inside the Flask
application by performing these steps:

1.  Our application might require different parameters depending on the system.

Because of this, we must build an object that loads parameters from a .yml file and
serves them as a dictionary throughout the application. In our src/config.py
file, first, we import what we need with the following code:

import os
import sys
from typing import Dict, List

import yaml

276     Structuring a Python Flask App for Rust

We will be using the sys module to take in the arguments that were passed into our
application while running it. We use the os module to check whether the config file
that we have specified in the arguments exists.

2.  Our global parameters object can be built using the following code:

class GlobalParams(dict):

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.update(self.get_yml_file())

    @staticmethod
    def get_yml_file() -> Dict:
        file_name = sys.argv[-1]
        if ".yml" not in file_name:
            file_name = "config.yml"

        if os.path.isfile(file_name):
            with open("./{}".format(file_name)) as \
              file:
                data = yaml.load(file,
                       Loader=yaml.FullLoader)
            return data
        raise FileNotFoundError(
            "{} config file is not available".
                format(file_name)
        )
    @property
    def database_meta(self) -> Dict[str, str]:
        db_string: str = self.get("DB_URL")
        buffer: List[str] = db_string.split("/")
        second_buffer: List[str] = buffer[- \
          2].split(":")
        third_buffer: List[str] = \
          second_buffer[1].split("@")
        return {
            "DB_URL": db_string,

Defining our data access layer     277

            "DB_NAME": buffer[-1],
            "DB_USER": second_buffer[0],
            "DB_PASSWORD": third_buffer[0],
            "DB_LOCATION":f"{third_buffer[1]} \
              :{second_buffer[-1]}",
        }

Here, you can observe that our GlobalParams class directly inherits from the
dictionary class. This means that we have all the functionality of a dictionary. In
addition to this, note that we do not pass any arguments into our Python program
specifying which .yml file to load; instead, we simply revert to the standard
config.yml file. This is because we will use our configuration file for migrations
to the database. It will be difficult to pass in our parameters when performing
database migrations. If we want to change the configuration, it is best to get the new
data and write it to the config file.

3.  Now that our config parameters class has been defined, we can add the database

URL to our src/config.yml file using the following code:

DB_URL: \
"postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/fib"

Now that we have access to our database URL, in the next step, we can build our database
access layer.

Building our data access layer
Our database access will be defined in the src/data_access.py file. Once this
is done, we can import the data access layer from the src/data_access.py file
anywhere in the Flask application. This is so that we can access the database anywhere
inside the Flask application. We can build this by performing the following steps:

1.  First of all, we have to import what we need using the following code:

from flask import _app_ctx_stack
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import
declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker,
scoped_session
from config import GlobalParams

278     Structuring a Python Flask App for Rust

Here, we will use the _app_ctx_stack object to ensure that our session is
in the context of the Flask request. Following this, we import all of the other
sqlalchemy dependencies to ensure that our access has a session maker and an
engine. We have to avoid going into excessive detail with database management as
this book focuses on fusing Rust with Python and we are merely using SQLAlchemy
to explore database integration with Rust. However, we should be able to get a feel
for what the session, engine, and base do.

2.  Now that we have imported everything we need, we can build our database engine

using the following code:

class DbEngine:

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        params = GlobalParams()
        self.base = declarative_base()
        self.engine = create_engine(params.get
          ("DB_URL"),
                                   echo=True,
                                   pool_recycle=3600,
                                   pool_size=2,
                                   max_overflow=1,
                                   connect_args={
                                  'connect_timeout': 5
                                    })
        self.session = scoped_session(sessionmaker(
            bind=self.engine
        ), scopefunc=_app_ctx_stack)
        self.url = params.get("DB_URL")

dal = DbEngine()

Defining our data access layer     279

Now we have a class that can give us database sessions, a database connection,
and a base. However, it must be noted that we initiated the DbEngine class and
assigned it to the dal variable; however, we didn't import the DbEngine class
outside of this file. Instead, we import the dal variable to be used for interactions
with the database. If we import the DbEngine class outside of this file during
initiation and use it whenever we want to interact with the database, we will create
multiple database sessions per request and these sessions will struggle to close. Even
something as small as a couple of users will grind your database to a halt with too
many hanging connections. Now that our database connection has been defined, in
the next step, we can move on to build our database models.

3.

In our database model, we can have a unique ID, input number, and fib number.
Our model is defined in the src/models/database/fib_entry.py file with
the following code:

from typing import Dict
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer
from data_access import dal

class FibEntry(dal.base):

    __tablename__ = "fib_entries"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    input_number = Column(Integer)
    calculated_number = Column(Integer)

    @property
    def package(self) -> Dict[str, int]:
        return {
            "input_number": self.input_number,
            "calculated_number": \
              self.calculated_number
        }

280     Structuring a Python Flask App for Rust

Here, you can see that the code is straightforward. We pass dal.base through our
model to add the model to the metadata. Then, we define the table name that will be in the
database and model fields, which are id, input_number, and calculated_number.
Our database model has now been defined, so we can import and use it throughout
our application. Additionally, we will use this in the next step to manage the database
migrations.

Setting up the application database migration system
Migrations are a useful tool for keeping track of all the changes made to our database. If
we make a change in a database model or define one, we need to translate those changes to
our database. We can achieve this by performing the following steps:

1.  For our database management, we are going to lean on the alembic package. Once

we have navigated inside the src/ directory, we run the following command:

alembic init alembic

This will generate a range of scripts and files. We are interested in the src/
alembic/env.py file; we are going to alter this so that we can connect our
alembic scripts and commands to our database.

2.  Next, we must import the os and sys modules, as we will be using them to import
our models and load our configuration file. We import the modules using the
following code:

import sys
import os

3.  Following this, we use the os module to append the path that is in the src/

directory with the following code:

from alembic import context

# this is the Alembic Config object, which provides
# access to the values within the .ini file in use.
Config = context.config

# Interpret the config file for Python logging.
# This line sets up loggers basically.
fileConfig(config.config_file_name)
# add the src to our import path

Defining our data access layer     281

sys.path.append(os.path.join(
    os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)),
    "../")
)

4.  Now that we have configured our import path, we can import our parameters

and database engine. Then, we add our database URL to our alembic database
URL using the following code:

# config the database url for migrations
from config import GlobalParams
params = GlobalParams()
section = config.config_ini_section
db_params = params.database_meta

config.set_section_option(section, 'sqlalchemy.url',
                          params.get('DB_URL'))

from data_access import dal
db_engine = dal

from models.database.fib_entry import FibEntry

target_metadata = db_engine.base.metadata

5.  With this, you can observe that the autogenerated function gets our config, which

then executes the migrations with the following code:

def run_migrations_offline():
    url = config.get_main_option("sqlalchemy.url")
    context.configure(
        url=url,

        render_as_batch=True
    )

282     Structuring a Python Flask App for Rust

    with context.begin_transaction():
        context.run_migrations()

6.  Now that we have our configuration system linked up to our database migrations,
we have to make sure docker-compose is running because our database has to
be live. We can generate a migration using the following command:

alembic revision --autogenerate -m create-fib-entry

This gives us the following printout:

INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl
PostgresqlImpl.
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume
transactional DDL.
INFO  [alembic.autogenerate.compare] Detected added
table 'fib_entries'

You can observe that in our src/alembic/versions/ file, there is an
autogenerated script that creates our table with the following code:

# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
Revision = '40b83d85c278'
down_revision = None
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None

def upgrade():
    op.create_table('fib_entries',
    sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),
    sa.Column('input_number', sa.Integer(),\
      nullable=True),
    sa.Column('calculated_number', sa.Integer(), \
     nullable=True),
    sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint('id')
    )
def downgrade():
    op.drop_table('fib_entries')

Defining our data access layer     283

Here, if we upgrade, the upgrade function will run, and if we downgrade, the
downgrade function will run. We can upgrade our database using the following
command:

alembic upgrade head

This gives us the following printout:

INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl
PostgresqlImpl.
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume
transactional DDL.
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade  ->
40b83d85c278, create-fib-entry

Our migration has worked. In the next step, we will interact with the database in our
application.

Building database models
Now that we have a database that has our application models applied to it, we can interact
with our database in the application. This can be done by importing our data access layer
and data model into the view that is using them and, well, use them:

1.  For our example, we will be implementing our view inside the src/app/app.py
file. First, we import the data access layer and model using the following code:

from data_access import dal
from models.database.fib_entry import FibEntry

With these imports, we can alter our calculation view to check whether the number
exists in the database and return the number from the database if it does.

2.

If it is not available in the database, then we calculate it, save the result in the
database, and return the result using the following code:

@app.route("/calculate/<int:number>")
def calculate(number):
    fib_calc = dal.session.query(FibEntry).filter_by(
           input_number=number).one_or_none()
    if fib_calc is None:
        calc = FibCalculation(input_number=number)
        new_calc = FibEntry(input_number=number,

284     Structuring a Python Flask App for Rust

                  calculated_number=calc.fib_number)
        dal.session.add(new_calc)
        dal.session.commit()

        return f"you entered {calc.input_number} " \
               f"which has a Fibonacci number of " \
               f"{calc.fib_number}"
    return f"you entered {fib_calc.input_number} "
       f"which has an existing Fibonacci number of "
           f"{fib_calc.calculated_number}"

Here, you can observe that our interactions with the database are straightforward.

3.  Now we have to make sure that when our request has finished, our database sessions

are expired, closed, and removed using the following code:

@app.teardown_request
def teardown_request(*args, **kwargs):
    dal.session.expire_all()
    dal.session.remove()
    dal.session.close()

So, we have a safe and fully functioning interaction with our database. You are now aware
of the fundamentals of interacting with a database using our application. You can achieve
other, more complex database queries by reading the SQLAlchemy documentation about
the specifics of the database, other database queries, and insertions as a way to map
syntax. If we run our application locally and hit our calculation view twice, we will get the
first and second results, as shown in the following screenshot:

Figure 9.5 – The top part is the first request (calculated), and the
bottom part is the second request (database call)

Defining our data access layer     285

Our database is working the way we expect it to. Now the application is fully functioning,
and you can move on to the next section if you wish, as this is enough to test Rust code
in a Flask application, which we will do in the next chapter. However, if you want to
understand how we apply the database in our deployment section, we will cover this next.

Applying the database access layer to the fib
calculation view
Adding a database to our deployment is a matter of adding it to our docker-compose
deployment and updating our configuration file to map to the database service in the
docker-compose deployment. We can achieve this by performing the following steps:

1.  First, we have to refactor our deployment/docker-compose.yml file using

the following code:

services:

    flask_app:
        container_name: fib-calculator
        image: "flask-fib:latest"
        restart: always
        ports:
          - "5002:5002"
        expose:
            - 5002
        depends_on:
          - postgres
        links:
          - postgres

    nginx:
        . . .

    postgres:
        container_name: 'fib-live-postgres'
        image: 'postgres:11.2'
        restart: always
        ports:

286     Structuring a Python Flask App for Rust

            - '5432:5432'
        environment:
            - 'POSTGRES_USER=user'
            - 'POSTGRES_DB=fib'
            - 'POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password'

You can observe that we have a slightly different name for our database container.
This is to ensure that there are no clashes with our development database.
Additionally, we have declared that our Flask application is dependent on and
linked to our database.

2.  We also have to point our Flask application to the Docker database. To do this, we
have to have a different configuration file for our Flask application. We can manage
the configuration file switch in src/Dockerfile for the Flask application. This
can be done using the following code:

# Copy the current directory contents into the
  container at /app
ADD . /app

RUN rm ./config.yml
RUN mv live_config.yml config.yml
. . .

Here, we remove the config.yml file and then change the filename of the
live_config.yml file to config.yml.

3.  Then, we have to make our src/live_config.yml file with the following

content:

DB_URL: "postgresql://user:password@postgres:5432/fib"

Here, we have changed @localhost to @postgres because the classification
of our service is called postgres.

4.  Following this, we can rebuild our Flask image using the following command:

docker build . -t flask-fib

Building a message bus      287

5.  Now we can run our docker-compose deployment, but we will have to run our
migrations while our docker-compose deployment is running. This is because
our Flask application will not cause an error if it is out of sync with the database
until we try and make a query to the database, so running docker-compose
before migrating is fine if we make no requests. When we make the migration, we
must do this while the database in docker-compose is running; otherwise, the
migration will not be able to connect to the database. We can run the migration
while docker-compose is running using the following command:

docker exec -it fib-calculator alembic upgrade head

This runs the migrations on our Flask container. It is not advised that you only have
your live configuration files within your application code. A favorite method of mine
is to upload an encrypted configuration file in AWS S3 and pull it in Kubernetes as it
starts up a pod. This is beyond the scope of this book, as this is not a web development
book. However, it is important to keep methods such as this in mind for further reading
if needed.

Right now, there is not much to complain about when it comes to calculating Fibonacci
numbers with our Flask application. However, when we try and calculate a large number,
we will be waiting for a long time, and this will keep the request hanging. To prevent this
from occurring, in the next section, we are going to implement a message bus. This is so
that while our application is processing large numbers in the background, we can return
a message telling the users to be patient.

Building a message bus
For this section, we will be using the Celery and Redis packages to build and run our
message bus. Once we have completed this section, our mechanism will take a form that
is similar to the following:

Figure 9.6 – A message bus with Flask and Celery

288     Structuring a Python Flask App for Rust

As shown in the preceding diagram, we have two processes running. One is running
our Flask application, while the other is running Celery, which handles queuing and
processing tasks. To make this work, we are going to perform the following steps:

1.  Build a Celery broker for Flask.

2.  Build a Fibonacci calculation task for Celery.
3.  Update our calculation view with Celery.
4.  Define our Celery service in Docker.

Before we embark on these steps, we have to install the following packages using pip:

•  Celery: This is the message bus broker that we are going to use.

•  Redis: This is the storage system that Celery is going to use.

Now that we have installed the requirements, we have to remember to update the
src/requirements.txt file with Celery and Redis for our Docker builds. Now
that we have all of our dependencies installed, we can start building our Celery broker,
as demonstrated next.

Building a Celery broker for Flask
Essentially, our Celery broker is a storage system that will store data concerning the
tasks we have sent to it. We can set up our storage system and connect it to our Celery
system using the following steps:

1.  We are going to build our own module when building our task queue. Inside the

src/ directory, our task queue module will take the following structure:

└── task_queue
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── engine.py
    └── fib_calc_task.py

Our engine.py file will host a constructor for Celery that considers the context
of the Flask application.

2.  We will build our Fibonacci calculation Celery task in the fib_calc_task.py
file. In our engine.py file, we can build our constructor using the following code:

Building a message bus      289

from celery import Celery
from config import GlobalParams

def make_celery(flask_app):
    params = GlobalParams()
    celery = Celery(
        backend=params.get("QUEUE_BACKEND"),
        broker=params.get("QUEUE_BROKER")
    )
    celery.conf.update(flask_app.config)

    class ContextTask(celery.Task):
        def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            with flask_app.app_context():
                return self.run(*args, **kwargs)

    celery.Task = ContextTask
    return celery

The backend and broker parameters will point to the storage; we will define
them later. Here, you can observe that we must pass the Flask application into the
function, construct the Celery class, and fuse a Celery task object with the Flask
application context and then return it. When it comes to defining an entry point
for running our Celery process, we should place it in the same file as our Flask
application. This is because we want to use the same Docker build and, thus, image
for the Flask application and Celery process.

3.  To achieve this, we import our Celery constructor and pass the Flask application

through it, in the src/app.py file, using the following code:

. . .
from task_queue.engine import make_celery

app = Flask(__name__)
celery = make_celery(app)
. . .

290     Structuring a Python Flask App for Rust

4.  Now, when we run our Celery broker, we will point it at our src/app.py file
and the Celery object inside it. Additionally, we must define our backend
storage system. Because we are using Redis, we can define these parameters
in our src/config.yml file using the following code:

QUEUE_BACKEND: "redis://localhost:6379/0"
QUEUE_BROKER: "redis://localhost:6379/0"

Now that we have defined our Celery broker, in the next step, we can build our
Fibonacci calculation task.

Building a Fibonacci calculation task for Celery
When it comes to running our Celery task, we need to build another constructor.
However, instead of passing in our Flask application, we pass in our Celery broker.
We can achieve this in the src/task_queue/fib_calc_task.py file using the
following code:

from data_access import dal
from fib_calcs.fib_calculation import FibCalculation
from models.database.fib_entry import FibEntry

def create_calculate_fib(input_celery):
    @input_celery.task()
    def calculate_fib(number):
        calculation = FibCalculation(input_number=number)
        fib_entry = FibEntry(
            input_number=calculation.input_number,
            calculated_number=calculation.fib_number
        )
        dal.session.add(fib_entry)
        dal.session.commit()
    return calculate_fib

The preceding logic is like our standard calculation view. We can import it into our
src/app.py file and pass our Celery broker to it using the following code:

. . .
from task_queue.engine import make_celery

Building a message bus      291

app = Flask(__name__)
celery = make_celery(app)

from task_queue.fib_calc_task import create_calculate_fib
calculate_fib = create_calculate_fib(input_celery=celery)
. . .

Now that we have our task defined and fused with our Celery broker and Flask
application, in the next step, we can add our Celery task to the calculation view if the
number is too large.

Updating our calculation view
With our view, we must check to see whether our input number is less than 31 and not
in the database. If it is, we run our standard existing code. However, if the input number
is 30 or above, we will send the calculation to the Celery broker and return a message
telling the user that it has been sent to the queue. We can do this using the following code:

@app.route("/calculate/<int:number>")
def calculate(number):
    fib_calc = dal.session.query(FibEntry).filter_by(
                       input_number=number).one_or_none()
    if fib_calc is None:
        if number < 31:
            calc = FibCalculation(input_number=number)
            new_calc = FibEntry(input_number=number,
                                calculated_number=calc.
                                fib_number)
            dal.session.add(new_calc)
            dal.session.commit()

            return f"you entered {calc.input_number} " \
                   f"which has a Fibonacci number of " \
                   f"{calc.fib_number}"
        calculate_fib.delay(number)
        return "calculate fib sent to queue because " \
               "it's above 30"
    return f"you entered {fib_calc.input_number} " \

292     Structuring a Python Flask App for Rust

           f"which has an existing Fibonacci number of " \
           f"{fib_calc.calculated_number}"

Now our Celery process with our task has been fully built. In the next step, we will
define our Redis service in docker-compose.

Defining our Celery service in Docker
When it comes to our Celery service, remember that we used Redis as a storage
mechanism. Considering this, we define our Redis service in our developed docker-
compose.yml file using the following code:

. . .
    redis:
      container_name: 'main-dev-redis'
      image: 'redis:5.0.3'
      ports:
        - '6379:6379'

Now running our whole system in develop mode requires running our developed
docker-compose file at the root of our project. Additionally, we run the Flask
application by running our app.py file with Python, where PYTHONPATH is set to src.

Following this, we open another Terminal window, navigate the Terminal inside the src
directory, and run the following command:

celery -A app.celery worker -l info

This is where we point Celery to the app.py file. We state that the object is called
Celery, that it is a worker, and that the logging is at the info level. Running this gives
us the following printout:

-------------- celery@maxwells-MacBook-Pro.

The preceding printout shows us that our task has been registered and that four processes
have been spun up. Hitting the calculation view with our Celery processes using a
number higher than 30 gives us the following view:

Figure 9.7 – The bottom shows the first request with Celery, and the top shows the
 second request with Celery

294     Structuring a Python Flask App for Rust

Our Flask application with a database and Celery message bus is now fully working
locally. You can stop here if you wish, as this is enough to test Rust code in Celery in
the next chapter. However, if you want to learn how to apply Celery to the deployment
section, continue with this section.

Applying Celery to our docker-compose deployment is straightforward. Remember
that we have the same entry point, so there is no need for a new image. Instead, all
we have to do is change the command that we run when spinning up our Celery
container. This can be done in our deployment/docker-compose.yml file
using the following code:

. . .
    main_cache:
        container_name: 'main-live-redis'
        image: 'redis:5.0.3'
        ports:
            - '6379:6379'

    queue_worker:
        container_name: fib-worker
        image: "flask-fib:latest"
        restart: always
        entrypoint: "celery -A app.celery worker -l info"
        ports:
            - "5003:5003"
        expose:
            - 5003
        depends_on:
            - main_cache
        links:
            - main_cache

Summary     295

Here, you can observe that we pull the same image for our queue_worker service.
However, we change the CMD tag in our Docker build using the entrypoint tag in
docker-compose. So, when our queue_worker service is built, it will run the
Celery command running the Celery workers, as opposed to running the Flask
web application. Following this, we need to add some more parameters to our live_
config.yml file using the following code:

QUEUE_BACKEND: "redis://main_cache:6379/0"
QUEUE_BROKER: "redis://main_cache:6379/0"

Here, we have named our Redis service as opposed to the localhost. This is so that our
packaged Celery worker and Flask application will connect to our Redis service in the
docker-compose deployment. After running the docker-compose deployment,
we can repeat the requests demonstrated in Figure 9.6 with localhost as opposed to
127.0.0.1:5002. With this, our Flask application is ready to deploy with a database
and task queue. Technically, our setup can be deployed and used on a server. I have done
this, and it works just fine. However, for more advanced systems and control, it is advised
that you carry out some further reading. Additional references about deploying Flask
applications in Docker to cloud services such as Amazon Web Services are listed in the
Further reading section.

Summary
In this chapter, we built a Python Flask application that had access to a database
and message bus to allow the queuing of heavy tasks in the background. Following
this, we wrapped our services in Docker containers and deployed them in a simple
docker-compose file with NGINX. Additionally, we learned how to build our
Celery worker and Flask application in the same Dockerfile using the same build.
This made our code easier to maintain and deploy. We also managed our migrations
for our database using alembic and a configuration file, which was then switched to
another configuration file when we were deploying our application. While this is not
a web development textbook, we have covered all of the essentials when it comes to
structuring a Flask web application.

Further details regarding database queries, data serialization, or HTML and CSS
rendering are covered, in a straightforward manner, in the Flask documentation. We have
covered all of the difficult stuff. Now, we can experiment with Rust and how it can be
fused with a Python web application, not just in a development setting but a live setting
where the application is running in a Docker container while communicating with other
Docker containers. In the next chapter, we will fuse Rust with our Flask application. This
is so that it can work with the development and deployment settings.

296     Structuring a Python Flask App for Rust

Questions

1.  What do we change in the URI when we switch from development to deployment

on docker-compose to communicate with another service?

2.  Why do we use configuration files?
3.  Do we really need alembic to manage the database?

4.  What do we have to do to our database engine to ensure our database does not get

flooded with hanging sessions?

5.  Do we need Redis for our Celery worker process?

Answers

1.  We switch the localhost part of the URI to the tag of the docker-compose

service.

2.  Configuration files enable us to switch contexts easily; for instance, switching from
development to live. Additionally, if our Celery service needs to talk to a different
database for some reason, this can be done with minimal effort; simply changing
the configuration file will work. It is also a security issue. Hardcoding database URIs
will expose these credentials to anyone who has access to the code and will be in the
GitHub repository history. Store the configuration file in a different space such as
AWS S3, which gets pulled when the service is deployed.

3.  Technically, no. We can simply write SQL scripts and run them in sequence.

When I was working in financial technology, this was actually a thing that we had
to do. While this can give you more freedom, it does take more time and is more
error-prone. Using alembic will save you time, errors, and work for pretty much
most of your needs.

4.  We initiate our database engine once in the same file where our engine is defined.
We never initiate it again, and we import this initiated engine anywhere we need.
Not doing so will lead to our database to a grinding halt with dangling sessions and
not very helpful error messages that will have you running around in circles on the
internet with vague half-baked answers. Additionally, we have to close our sessions
in the Flask teardown function for all requests.

5.  Yes and no. We require a storage mechanism such as Redis; however, we can also

use RabbitMQ or MongoDB instead of Redis if needed.

Injecting Rust into a
Python Flask App

In Chapter 9, Structuring a Python Flask App for Rust, we set up a basic Python web
application in Flask that could be deployed using Docker. In this chapter, we are going
to fuse Rust into every aspect of that web application. This means polishing our skills
of defining Rust packages that can be installed using pip. With these packages, we are
going to plug Rust code into our Flask and Celery containers. We are also going to directly
interact with an existing database using Rust, without having to worry about migrations.
This is because our Rust package is going to mirror the schema of the existing database.
We will need a Rust nightly version to compile our package, so we will also learn how
to manage Rust nightly when building our Flask image. We will also learn how to use
Rust packages from private GitHub repositories.

In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

•  Fusing Rust into Flask and Celery

•  Deploying Flask and Celery with Rust

•  Deploying with a private GitHub repository

•  Fusing Rust with data access

•  Deploying Rust nightly in Flask

300     Injecting Rust into a Python Flask App

Learning about these topics will enable us to use our Rust packages in a Python web
application so that it can be deployed in Docker. This will bring our Rust skills directly in
line with the real world, enabling us to speed up Python web applications without having
to rewrite our entire infrastructure. If you are a Python web developer, you will be able to
turn up to work after reading this chapter and start injecting Rust into web applications to
introduce fast, safe code without much risk.

Technical requirements
The following are the technical requirements for this chapter:

•  The code and data for this chapter can be found at https://github.com/

PacktPublishing/Speed-up-your-Python-with-Rust/tree/main/
chapter_ten.

•  In this chapter, you will be building a Docker-contained Flask application. This
is available via the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/
maxwellflitton/fib-flask.

Fusing Rust into Flask and Celery
We will fuse Rust into our Flask application by installing our Rust Fibonacci calculation
library using pip. We will then use it in our views and Celery tasks. This will speed up our
Flask application without us having to make big changes to our infrastructure. To achieve
this, we will carry out the following steps:

1.  Define our dependency on the Rust Fibonacci number calculation package.

2.  Build our calculation module with Rust.

3.  Create a calculation view using Rust in our Flask application.

4.

Insert Rust into our Celery task.

With this, we will have a Flask application that has a speedup due to Rust. Let's get started!

Fusing Rust into Flask and Celery     301

Defining our dependency on the Rust Fibonacci
number calculation package
When it comes to our Rust dependency, it would be tempting to just put our Rust
dependency in our requirements.txt file. However, this can become confusing.
Also, we are using an automated process to update our requirements.txt file. This
runs the risk of wiping our GitHub repositories from the requirements.txt file. We
must remember that our requirements.txt file is just a text file. Therefore, nothing is
stopping us from just adding another text file that lists our GitHub repositories and using
it to install the GitHub repositories that our application is dependent on. To do this, we
will populate our src/git_repos.txt file with the following dependency:

git+https://github.com/maxwellflitton/flitton-fib-rs@main

Now, we can install our GitHub repository dependencies with the following command:

pip install -r git_repos.txt

This will result in our Python system downloading the GitHub repository and compiling
it in our Python packages. We now know which GitHub repositories are powering our
application, so we can start using automation tools to update our requirements.
txt file. Now that we have installed our Rust package, we can start building a calculation
module that will use Rust.

Building our calculation model with Rust
Our calculation module will have the following structure:

src
├── fib_calcs
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── enums.py
│   └── fib_calculation.py

We already have our Python calculation in the fib_calculation.py file from
the previous chapter. However, we are now supporting both Rust and Python
implementations.

302     Injecting Rust into a Python Flask App

To do this, we will start by defining an enum in our enums.py file with the
following code:

from enum import Enum

class CalculationMethod(Enum):

    PYTHON = "python"
    RUST = "rust"

With this enum, we can keep adding methods. For instance, if we were to develop
microservices later on and have a separate server for calculating our Fibonacci numbers,
we can add an API call to our enum and support it in our calculation interface. Depending
on the configuration file, we can switch between all of them. Now that we have defined
our enums, we can build our interface in the src/fib_calcs/__init__.py file:

1.  First of all, we have to import what we need with the following code:

import time
from flitton_fib_rs.flitton_fib_rs import \
  fibonacci_number
from fib_calcs.enums import CalculationMethod
from fib_calcs.fib_calculation import FibCalculation

Here, we used the time module to time how long a process takes to run. We also
imported our Python and Rust implementations for our calculations. Finally, we
imported our enum to map which method we used.

2.  With all of this, we can start building the time process function in our src/fib_

calcs/__init__.py file with the following code:

def _time_process(processor, input_number):
    start = time.time()
    calc = processor(input_number)
    finish = time.time()
    time_taken = finish - start
    return calc, time_taken

Fusing Rust into Flask and Celery     303

Here, we took in a calculation function under the processor parameter name and
passed the input_number parameter into the function. We also timed this process
and returned it with the Fibonacci number. Now that we've done this, we can build
a function that processes an input string and convert that into our enum. We will
not always pass a string into our interface, but if we can load a string signaling what
process type we want from a configuration file, this will be important.

3.  Our processing method can be defined with the following code:

def _process_method(input_method):
    calc_enum = CalculationMethod._value2member_map_.
                get(input_method)
    if calc_enum is None:
        raise ValueError(
            f"{input_method} is not supported, "
            f"please choose from "
     f"{CalculationMethod._value2member_map_.keys()}")
    return calc_enum

Here, we can see that our string is stored in the key values of the
_value2member_map_ map. If it is not in the keys, then our enum will
not support it, and the method will throw an error. However, if it exists, we
return the enum associated with the key value.

4.  Now, we can define the two helper functions for our interface with the following

code:

def calc_fib_num(input_number, method):
    if isinstance(method, str):
        method = _process_method(input_method=method)

    if method == CalculationMethod.PYTHON:
        calc, time_taken = _time_process(
            processor=FibCalculation,
            input_number=input_number
        )
        return calc.fib_number, time_taken

    elif method == CalculationMethod.RUST:
        calc, time_taken = _time_process(

304     Injecting Rust into a Python Flask App

            processor=fibonacci_number,
            input_number=input_number
        )
        return calc, time_taken

Here, if we pass in a string for our method, we can convert it into an enum. If the enum
points to Python, we can pass our Python calculation object, along with the input number,
into our _time_process function. Then, we can return the Fibonacci number and
time taken. If our enum points to Rust, we can perform the same operations but with
the Rust function. With this approach, we can add and take away functionality. For
instance, we can switch the timing process with another parameter that's pointing to
another calculation function that does not time the process, resulting in a process that just
performs the calculation without timing it if we want. However, for this example, we will
be using the timing process to compare speeds. Now that we have built our interface, we
can create our calculation view with this interface.

Creating a calculation view using Rust
We are hosting our view in the src/app.py file. First, we will import our interface with
the following code:

from fib_calcs import calc_fib_num
from fib_calcs.enums import CalculationMethod

With this new interface and enum, we can make changes to our standard calculation view
with the following code:

@app.route("/calculate/<int:number>")
def calculate(number):
    fib_calc = dal.session.query(FibEntry).filter_by(
      input_number=number).one_or_none()
    if fib_calc is None:
        if number < 50:
            fib_number, time_taken = calc_fib_num(
                input_number=number,
                method=CalculationMethod.PYTHON
            )
            . . .

            return f"you entered {number} " \

Fusing Rust into Flask and Celery     305

                   f"which has a Fibonacci number of " \
                   f"{fib_number} which took {time_taken}"
    . . .

Here, we are using the new interface. Because of this, we can also return the time taken to
perform the calculation. Now, we can build our Rust calculation view. It will take the same
form as the standard calculation view, meaning that you can refactor it to have the Rust
and Python calculation methods in the same view based on the parameter that's passed
into the URL. If not, our Rust calculation view will take the form of the following code:

@app.route("/rust/calculate/<int:number>")
def rust_calculate(number):
    . . .
    if fib_calc is None:
        if number < 50:
            fib_number, time_taken = calc_fib_num(
                input_number=number,
                method=CalculationMethod.RUST
            )
            . . .

The dots in the aforementioned code show that this is the same code that's used in the
standard calculation function. Now that our Rust package has been fused with our Flask
application, we can insert Rust into our Celery task.

Inserting Rust into our Celery task
When it comes to our background task in Celery, we do not have to worry about the
timing. Because of the interface and configuration, we have to import the parameters
and interface into the src/task_queue/fib_calc_task.py file with the
following code:

from config import GlobalParams
from fib_calcs import calc_fib_num

With this, we can now refactor our Celery task with the following code:

def create_calculate_fib(input_celery):
    @input_celery.task()
    def calculate_fib(number):

306     Injecting Rust into a Python Flask App

        params = GlobalParams()
        fib_number, _ = calc_fib_num(input_number=number,
                                     method=params.get(
                                     "CELERY_METHOD",
                                     "rust"))
        fib_entry = FibEntry(input_number=number,
            calculated_number=fib_number)
        dal.session.add(fib_entry)
        dal.session.commit()
    return calculate_fib

Here, we can see that we get the global parameters. We pass the CELERY_METHOD global
parameter into the params. Considering that the parameters are inherited from the
dictionary class, we can use the built-in get method. We can set the default calculation
method to rust if we have not defined CELERY_METHOD in the configuration file.

The application is now fully integrated, which means we can test our application. We must
remember to run our development docker-compose environment, Flask application,
and Celery worker. Accessing our two views will give us the following output:

Figure 10.1 – Flask, Python, and Rust requests

In the preceding screenshot, we can see that our Rust call is four times faster, even though
the Rust request number is higher. We now have a working Python application that uses
Rust to speed up the calculations. However, this is not very useful if we cannot deploy it.
The internet is full of half-baked tutorials that teach you how to do something superficially
in a development environment, while not being able to use or configure it in a production
environment. In the next section, we will configure our Docker environment so that we
can deploy our application.

Deploying Flask and Celery with Rust     307

Deploying Flask and Celery with Rust
For our Flask application's Docker image to support our Rust packages, we need to make
some changes to the src/Dockerfile file. Looking at this file, we can see that our
image is built on python:3.6.13-stretch. This is essentially a Linux environment
with Python installed. When we see this, we realize that we can be confident in
manipulating our Docker image environment. If we can do this in Linux, there is a high
chance we can do this in our Docker image. Considering this, what we must do in our
src/Dockerfile file is install Rust and register cargo with the following code:

. . .
RUN apt-get update -y
RUN apt-get install -y python3-dev python-dev gcc

# setup rust
RUN curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | bash -s -- -y –profile
  minimal –no-modify-path

# Add .cargo/bin to PATH
ENV PATH="/root/.cargo/bin:${PATH}"
. . .

Luckily for us, Rust is very easy to install. Remember that the apt-get install -y
python3-dev python-dev gcc command allows us to use compiled extensions
when using Python. Now that we've done this, we can pull and compile our Rust package
with the following code:

. . .
# Install the dependencies
RUN pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r git_repos.txt
. . .

Everything else is the same. Our image is now ready to be built with the following
command while our terminal is in the root of the src/ directory:

docker build . -t flask-fib

308     Injecting Rust into a Python Flask App

This will rebuild our Docker image for our Flask application. Some bits might be skipped
over in this build. Don't worry – Docker caches the layers in the image build that have not
been changed. This is denoted with the following printout:

Step 1/14 : FROM python:3.6.13-stretch
 ---> b45d914a4516
Step 2/14 : WORKDIR /app
 ---> Using cache
 ---> b0331f8a005d
Step 3/14 : ADD . /app
 ---> Using cache

Once a step has been changed, every step following it will be rerun since the interrupted
step might change the outcome of the steps following it. Note that the build might hang
when pip installs our Rust package. This is because the package is being compiled.
You may have noticed that we have to do this every time we install the Rust package. A
more optimal distribution strategy will be explored in the next chapter. Now, if we run
docker-compose in our deployment directory, we will see that we can use our Rust
Flask container without any problems.

Deploying with a private GitHub repository
If you are coding for a side project, company, or paid feature, you will be working with
private GitHub repositories. This makes sense as we do not want people accessing a
repository for free that you or your company plans on charging them for. However, if
we set our Rust Fibonacci package's GitHub repository to private, delete all of our Flask
images using the docker image rm YOUR_IMAGE_ID_HERE command, and run
our docker build . -t flask-fib command again, we would get the following
printout:

Deploying with a private GitHub repository     309

This is because our isolated Linux-based Docker image that is being built is not logged
into GitHub, even though we are. As a result, the image that's being built could not
pull the package from the GitHub repository. We could pass our GitHub credentials
into the build via arguments, but this will show up in the image build layers. Therefore,
anyone who has access to our image could look and see our GitHub credentials. This is a
security hazard. Docker does have some documentation on passing in secrets. However,
at the time of writing this book, the documentation is sparse and convoluted. A more
straightforward approach is to clone our flitton-fib-rs package outside the image
and pass it into the Docker image build, as shown here:

Figure 10.2 – Private repository image build flow

310     Injecting Rust into a Python Flask App

If we are going to use a continuous integration tool such as GitHub Actions or Travis, then
we can run the process laid out in the preceding diagram with GitHub credentials passed
in as secrets. GitHub Actions and Travis handle secrets with efficiency and simplicity. If we
are building it locally, as we are doing in this example, then we should already be logged
into GitHub as we are directly working on the Flask project in this project. To carry out
the process laid out in the preceding diagram, we must carry out the following steps:

1.  Build a Bash script that orchestrates the process depicted in the preceding diagram.

2.  Reconfigure our Rust Fib package installment in our Dockerfile.

This is the most straightforward approach to using private GitHub repositories in our web
application builds. We will start by looking at the Bash script.

Building a Bash script that orchestrates the whole
process
Our script is housed in src/build_image.sh. First, we must declare that this is a Bash
script and that the code should run in the directory of the Flask application. To do so, we
must change to the directory that contains the script with the following code:

#!/usr/bin/env bash

SCRIPTPATH="$( cd "$(dirname "$0")" ; pwd -P )"
cd $SCRIPTPATH

Now, we have to clone our package and remove our .git file from the repository with the
following code:

git clone https://github.com/maxwellflitton/flitton-fib-
  rs.git
rm -rf ./flitton-fib-rs/.git

Now, our package is just a directory. We are ready to build our Docker image. However,
if we do so, it might not work because our files might be cached. To prevent this from
happening, we can run our build with no cache and then remove our cloned package after
the build with the following code:

docker build . --no-cache -t flask-fib

rm -rf ./flitton-fib-rs

Deploying with a private GitHub repository     311

We will have to run this script to run a build of our Flask application. However, if we
were to run a build now, it would not work as our Dockerfile will still be trying to pull the
directory from GitHub. To fix this, we will move on to the second step.

Reconfiguring the Rust Fib package installment in our
Dockerfile
In our src/Dockerfile file, we must remove the RUN pip install -r git_
repos.txt line as this will stop our image build from trying to pull from the GitHub
repository. Now, we can pip install the local directory that has been passed in, and
then remove it with the following code:

RUN pip install ./flitton-fib-rs
RUN rm -rf ./flitton-fib-rs

Now, we can build our Flask image by running the following command:

sh build_image.sh

This will result in a long printout that will eventually tell us that the image was successfully
built. Running our deployment docker-compose file will confirm this. You may want
to install our package from a different Git branch. This can be done by adding three more
lines to our src/build_image.sh file, as shown here:

. . .
git clone –branch $1
  https://github.com/maxwellflitton/flitton-fib-rs.git
cd flitton-fib-rs
cd ..
rm -rf ./flitton-fib-rs/.git
. . .

Here, we cloned the repository containing the branch, whose name is based on the
argument that's passed into the script. Once we've done this, we can remove the Git
history by removing the .git file.

Our Rust package is now fully fused with our Python web application in Docker. One
bonus of installing our Rust package when building an image is that it does not have to be
compiled every time we use the image.

312     Injecting Rust into a Python Flask App

Note
We can go one step further when it comes to reducing our build, though this
is optional. You do not have to do this to complete this chapter. Right now,
we are installing Rust and then compiling our Rust Python package for the
Fibonacci calculations. We can avoid the need to install Rust and compile every
time by building wheels for a range of Linux distributions and Python versions.
This can be done by pulling the ManyLinux Docker images and using them to
compile our package into multiple distributions.
The detailed steps on how to do this to your Python pip package coded in
Rust are laid out in the Rust setup tools documentation (see the Further reading
section). Once those steps are completed, you will end up with a range of
wheels in your dist directory. Copy and paste the 3.6 version into your Flask
src directory and instruct your Dockerfile to copy it into the image when
it is being built. Once you've done this, you can point the pip install
command directly to the wheel file you copied into the image build. The
installation will be nearly instant.

While fusing Rust with our Flask application is certainly useful, since we now have
a real-world example of how our Rust code can be used in a deployment setting,
we can go even further. In the next section, we will have our Rust code interact with
our database.

Fusing Rust with data access
In web applications, accessing a database is a big part of the process. We could import the
dal object that we created in the src/data_access.py file and pass it into our Rust
function, executing database operations through Python. While this will technically work,
it is not ideal as we will have to waste time and effort extracting objects from the database
queries, inspecting them, and converting them into Rust structs. We would then have to
convert the Rust structs into Python objects before inserting them into the database. This
is a lot of excess code that has a lot of interaction with Python, reducing its speed gain.

Fusing Rust with data access     313

Because a database is external from the Python web application, and it contains
information about its schema, we can completely bypass Python's implementations by
using the diesel Rust crate to automatically write our schema and database models in
Rust based on the live database. We can also use diesel to manage the connection to the
database. As a result, we can directly interact with the database, reducing our reliance on
Python, speeding up our code, and reducing the amount of code that we have to write. To
achieve this, we have to carry out the following steps:

1.  Set up our database cloning package.
2.  Set up our diesel environment.

3.  Autogenerate and configure our database models and schema.

4.  Define our database connection in Rust.

5.  Create a Rust function that gets all the Fibonacci records and returns them.

Once we have completed these steps, we will have a Rust package that interacts with the
database that can be added to our Flask application build and used if needed. We will start
by setting up our database cloning package.

Setting up our database cloning package
We should now be familiar with setting up a standard Rust package for Python. For our
database package, we will have the following layout:

├── Cargo.toml
├── diesel.toml
├── rust_db_cloning
│   └── __init__.py
├── setup.py
├── src
│   ├── database.rs
│   ├── lib.rs
│   ├── models.rs
│   └── schema.rs
├── .env

314     Injecting Rust into a Python Flask App

You should know the role of some of these files by now. The new files have the following
purposes:

•  database.rs: Houses the function that returns a database connection

•  models.rs: Houses the structs that define the database models, fields, and the

behavior of the individual rows of a table in the database

•  schema.rs: Houses the schema of the tables of the database

•  .env: Houses the database URL for our command-line interface (CLI)

interactions

•  Diesel.toml: Houses the configuration for our diesel CLI

Now, we can turn our attention to the setup.py file. Looking at the package layout,
you should be able to define this file yourself, and I encourage you to give it a try. Here is
an example of the barebones setup.py file that is needed to enable this package to be
installed with pip:

#!/usr/bin/env python
from setuptools import dist
dist.Distribution().fetch_build_eggs(['setuptools_rust'])
from setuptools import setup
from setuptools_rust import Binding, RustExtension

setup(
    name="rust-database-cloning",
    version="0.1",
    rust_extensions=[RustExtension(
        ".rust_db_cloning.rust_db_cloning",
        path="Cargo.toml", binding=Binding.PyO3)],
    packages=["rust_db_cloning"],
    zip_safe=False,
)

With this, our rust_db_cloning/__init__.py file contains the following code:

from .rust_db_cloning import *

Now, we can move onto our Cargo.toml file, which will list some dependencies that
you are familiar with, as well as the new diesel dependency:

Fusing Rust with data access     315

[package]
name = "rust_db_cloning"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["maxwellflitton"]
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]
diesel = { version = "1.4.4", features = ["postgres"] }
dotenv = "0.15.0"

[lib]
name = "rust_db_cloning"
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies.pyo3]
version = "0.13.2"
features = ["extension-module"]

With that, we have defined the basics for our package to be installed via pip. It will not
be installed yet as we have nothing in our src/lib.rs file, but we will fill that file out
in the final step. Now, we can move on to the next step, which is setting up our diesel
environment.

Setting up the diesel environment
We will be cloning our schema from our development database so that we can hardcode
the URL into our .env file, as follows:

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/fib

316     Injecting Rust into a Python Flask App

Since this database configuration will never end up in a production environment and is
merely used to generate the schema and models from a development database, it is OK if
this URL gets into the wrong hands. Having this hardcoded into your GitHub repository
is not the end of the world. With this in mind, we can define where we want our schema
to be printed in our diesel.toml file with the following code:

[print_schema]
file = "src/schema.rs"

Now that we have written everything we need, we can start installing and running the
diesel CLI. You may get compilation errors when installing and compiling diesel. If
this is the case while you are reading this, you can get around these compilation errors by
switching to Rust nightly. Rust nightly provides the latest releases of Rust; however,
it is less stable. Therefore, you should try and follow these steps without switching to
nightly but if you find that you need to, then you can switch to nightly by installing
it with the following code:

rustup toolchain install nightly

Once it has been installed, we can switch to nightly with the following command:

rustup default nightly

Your Rust compilations will be running in nightly now. Going back to setting up our
diesel environment, we have to install the diesel CLI with the following command:

cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features
--features postgres

With this, we can now use the CLI combined with the URL in the .env file to interact
with our database.

Fusing Rust with data access     317

Autogenerating and configuring our database models
and schema
In this step, we will be interacting with the development database in Docker. Considering
this, before moving on, you need to open another terminal and run the development
docker-compose environment in the flask-fib repository. Running this will
run the database that we will connect to so that we can access the database schema and
models. Now that the CLI has been installed, we can print the schema with the following
command:

diesel print-schema > src/schema.rs

There will be no printouts in the terminal but if we open our src/schema.rs file, we
will see the following code:

table! {
    alembic_version (version_num) {
        version_num -> Varchar,
    }
}
table! {
    fib_entries (id) {
        id -> Int4,
        input_number -> Nullable<Int4>,
        calculated_number -> Nullable<Int4>,
    }
}
allow_tables_to_appear_in_same_query!(
    alembic_version,
    fib_entries,
);

Here, we can see that our alembic version is in the schema as a separate table. This is
how alembic keeps track of the migrations. We can also see that our fib_entries
table has been mapped. While we could have done this ourselves without the diesel
CLI, it is a lifesaver, ensuring that the schema is always up to date with the database. This
also saves time in big, complex databases and reduces errors.

318     Injecting Rust into a Python Flask App

Now that our schema has been defined, we can define our models with the following
command:

diesel_ext > src/models.rs

This gives us the following code:

#![allow(unused)]
#![allow(clippy::all)]

#[derive(Queryable, Debug, Identifiable)]
#[primary_key(version_num)]
pub struct AlembicVersion {
    pub version_num: String,
}
#[derive(Queryable, Debug)]
pub struct FibEntry {
    pub id: i32,
    pub input_number: Option<i32>,
    pub calculated_number: Option<i32>,
}

This is not completely perfect, and we have to make some changes. The models do
not have the tables defined. diesel assumes that the table name is just the plural
of the model's name. For instance, if we have a data model called test, then diesel
would assume that the table is called tests. However, for us, this is not the case as we
specifically defined our tables in our Flask application when running migrations in the
previous chapter. We can also remove the two allow macros as we will not be using this
functionality. Instead, we will import our schemas and define them in the table macro.
After this rearrangement, our src/models.rs file should look like this:

use crate::schema::fib_entries;
use crate::schema::alembic_version;

#[derive(Queryable, Debug, Identifiable)]
#[primary_key(version_num)]
#[table_name="alembic_version"]
pub struct AlembicVersion {
    pub version_num: String,

Fusing Rust with data access     319

}
#[derive(Queryable, Debug, Identifiable)]
#[table_name="fib_entries"]
pub struct FibEntry {
    pub id: i32,
    pub input_number: Option<i32>,
    pub calculated_number: Option<i32>,
}

Our models and schema are now ready to be used in our Rust package. Considering this,
we can move on to the next step, which is defining our database connection.

Defining our database connection in Rust
Our database connection would traditionally take the database URL from the
environment and use this to make a connection. However, this is a Rust package that
is an appendage to our Flask application. There is no point in having another sensitive
piece of information that has to be loaded. Therefore, to avoid extra complications
and another point of security failure, we will merely pass the database URL from the
Flask application to make the connection, since the Flask application is managing
the configuration and loading the sensitive data anyway. The entirety of our database
connection can be handled in our src/database.rs file. First, we must import what
we need with the following code:

use diesel::prelude::*;
use diesel::pg::PgConnection;

prelude helps us use the diesel macros, and PgConnection is what we will return
to get a database connection. With this, we can build our database connection function
with the following code:

pub fn establish_connection(url: String) -> PgConnection {
    PgConnection::establish(&url)
      .expect(&format!("Error connecting to {}", url))
}

This can be imported anywhere where we need a database connection. At this point, we
can start creating a function that gets all the records and returns them in dictionaries.

320     Injecting Rust into a Python Flask App

Creating a Rust function that gets all the Fibonacci
records and returns them
To avoid excessive complexity in this example, we will be doing everything in the src/
lib.rs file. However, it is advised that you build some modules and import them into
the src/lib.rs file for more complex packages. First of all, we will import everything
we need to build the function and bind it with the following code:

#[macro_use] extern crate diesel;
extern crate dotenv;
use diesel::prelude::*;

use pyo3::prelude::*;
use pyo3::wrap_pyfunction;
use pyo3::types::PyDict;

mod database;
mod schema;
mod models;

use database::establish_connection;
use models::FibEntry;
use schema::fib_entries;

The order of the imports matters here. We import the diesel crate with macro use
straightaway. Therefore, files such as database and schema will not error out because
they are using diesel macros. dotenv is not being used in our example as we are
passing in the database URL from the Python system. However, it's useful to know about
this if you want to get database URLs from the environment. Then, we can import the
pyo3 macros and structs that we need, and the structs and functions that we defined.
With these imports, we can define our get_fib_entries function with the following
code:

#[pyfunction]
fn get_fib_entries(url: String, py: Python) -> Vec<&PyDict>
{

   let connection = establish_connection(url);

Fusing Rust with data access     321

   let fibs = fib_entries::table
       .order(fib_entries::columns::input_number.asc())
       .load::<FibEntry>(&connection)
       .unwrap();

   let mut buffer = Vec::new();

   for i in fibs {
       let placeholder = PyDict::new(py);
       placeholder.set_item("input number",
         i.input_number.unwrap());
       placeholder.set_item("fib number",
          i.calculated_number.unwrap());
       buffer.push(placeholder);
   }
}

Using Python to build a list of dictionaries is not new, and neither is the definition of
the function. What is new, however, is establishing a connection, ordering it using the
schema columns, and loading it as a list of FibEntry structs. We pass a reference to
the connection into our query and unwrap it as it returns a result. We can chain more
functions to it, such as .filter, if needed. The diesel documentation does a good job
of covering the different types of queries and inserts you can perform. Once we've done
this, we can add it to our rust_db_cloning module with the following code:

#[pymodule]
fn rust_db_cloning(py: Python, m: &PyModule)
    -> PyResult<()> {
    m.add_wrapped(wrap_pyfunction!(get_fib_enteries));
    Ok(())
}

With this, our code is ready to be uploaded to the GitHub repository and used in our
Flask application.

322     Injecting Rust into a Python Flask App

Now, we can quickly test whether our package works before defining it in our Dockerfile.
First of all, we need to pip install it in our Flask application virtual environment. This
is another point where you might have compilation issues. To get around this, you might
have to switch to Rust nightly to pip install the package you just built. Once our
package has been installed, we can check it out by adding a simple get view to our Flask
application. In the src/app.py file of our Flask application, we can import our function
with the following code:

from rust_db_cloning import get_fib_entries

Now, we can define our get view with the following code:

@app.route("/get")
def get():
    return str(get_fib_entries(dal.url))

Remember that in the previous chapter, we defined the url attribute of dal with the URL
from GlobalParams, which was loaded from the .yml config file. We have to turn it
into a string; otherwise, the Flask serialization will not be able to process it. Running this
in the development docker-compose environment will give us the following output:

Figure 10.3 – Simple get view from our Flask application

You may have different numbers, depending on what you have in your database. However,
what we have here is a Rust package that keeps up with the changes in the database that
can interact directly with the database. Now that this is working in our development setup,
we can start packaging our Rust nightly package for deployment.

Deploying Rust nightly in Flask
To package our nightly database Rust package so that it can be deployed, we have to
add another clone of our GitHub repository to our build Bash script, install nightly,
and switch to it when we are installing our database package with pip. You can probably
guess what we are going to achieve by cloning our database GitHub repository in our
Bash script.

For reference, our src/build_image.sh file will take the form of the following code:

Deploying Rust nightly in Flask     323

. . .
git clone https://github.com/maxwellflitton/
flitton-fib-rs.git
git clone https://github.com/maxwellflitton/
rust-db-cloning.git

rm -rf ./flitton-fib-rs/.git
rm -rf ./rust-db-cloning/.git

docker build . --no-cache -t flask-fib

rm -rf ./flitton-fib-rs
rm -rf ./rust-db-cloning

Here, we can see that we have merely added the code for cloning the rust-db-cloning
repository, removed the .git file in that rust-db-cloning repository, and then
removed the rust-db-cloning repository once the image build has finished. When it
comes to our Dockerfile, these steps will remain the same. The only difference is that after
installing our normal Rust package, we install nightly, switch to it, and then install our
database package. This can be achieved with the following code:

. . .
RUN pip install ./flitton-fib-rs
RUN rm -rf ./flitton-fib-rs

RUN rustup toolchain install nightly
RUN rustup default nightly

RUN pip install ./rust-db-cloning
RUN rm -rf ./rust-db-cloning
. . .

324     Injecting Rust into a Python Flask App

Even though one is compiled with normal Rust, while the other is compiled with Rust
nightly, they will both run fine when the application is running. Building this image
and running it in the deployment docker-compose environment will show us that
the container will process the Rust computation view and get it from the database view
without any problems. With this, we now have all the tools we need to fuse Rust into
Python web applications and deploy them in Docker.

Summary
In this chapter, we have put all our Rust fusing skills to work to build packages that are
baked into Docker images for a Python web application. We attached Rust packages
directly to the web application, and then to the Celery worker, resulting in a significant
speedup when we asked our web application to calculate the Fibonacci number.

Then, we altered our build process to take Rust packages from private GitHub repositories
when building our Python web application image. Finally, we connected directly to the
database with Rust and used Rust nightly to compile it. We managed to include this in
our Python web application Docker build. This resulted in us not only being able to fuse
Rust into a deployable web application but also use Rust nightly and databases to solve
our problems

With this in mind, we can now use what we have learned in this book for production web
applications. You can now start coding in Rust and plug your Rust packages into existing
Python web applications that can be deployed in Docker, without having to make major
changes to the Python web application build process.

Reaching for Rust to solve a speed bottleneck or to ensure that the code is consistent and
safe in a live Python web application is something you can do in your day job tomorrow.
You can now bring forward the fastest memory-safe programming language into your
Python projects without having to overhaul your existing system. You are now capable of
bridging the gap between practically maintaining an existing tried and tested system and a
cutting-edge language. In the next and final chapter, we will cover some best practices. But
right now, you know the key concepts to go and change your project or organization.

Questions

1.  How does directly connecting to a database in Rust reduce code?

2.  Why can't we just pass login credentials into our Docker image build Dockerfile?

3.  We did not make any migrations in this chapter. How did we map our models and
schema of a database to our Rust module, and how do we continue to keep up with
database changes?

Answers     325

4.  Why do we pass the database URL into our database Rust package as opposed to

loading it from a config file or environment?

5.  Do we have to do anything extra if we were going to fuse Rust with a Django, bottle,

or FastAPI Python web application?

Answers

1.  Directly connecting to a database with Rust reduces the amount of code we must
write as we do not have to inspect the Python objects that are returned from the
Python database call. We also do not have to package data into Python objects
before inserting them into the database. This essentially removes a whole layer of
code that we must write when interacting with the database.

2.

If someone gets hold of our image, they can access the layers of the build. As a
result, they can access the arguments that have been passed into the build. This will
mean that they can see the credentials we use to log in.

3.  We used the diesel crate to connect to the database and automatically print the

schemas and models based on the database it connects to. We can do this repeatedly
to keep up to date with new database migrations.

4.  We must remember that our Rust database package is an appendage to our Python
web application. Our Python web application has already loaded the database URL.
Loading credentials into our package just adds another possibility for a security
breach with no advantages.

5.  No – our fusing method is completely detached from the pip installation process

and the database mapping process.

Best Practices for
Integrating Rust

In Chapter 10, Injecting Rust into a Python Flask App, we managed to fuse our Rust code
with a Python web application. In this final chapter, we will wrap up what we have covered
in the book with best practices. These practices are not essential to fuse Rust with Python;
however, they will help us in avoiding pitfalls when building bigger packages in Rust.
When it comes to best practices, we can Google search the topic SOLID principles, which
will give us loads of free information on how to keep code generally clean. But instead
of regurgitating these principles, we will cover concepts that are specific to using Rust
and Python together. We will learn how to keep the Rust/Python implementation as
simple as possible if the requirements are not too demanding. We will also understand
what Python and Rust excel in when it comes to computational tasks and Python
interfaces. We then investigate traits in Rust and how they can help us organize and
structure our structs. Finally, we look into keeping it simple when we want data
parallelism with the Rayon crate.

In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

•  Keeping our Rust implementation simple by piping data to and from Rust

•  Giving the interface a native feel with objects

•  Using traits as opposed to objects

•  Keeping data-parallelism simple with Rayon

328     Best Practices for Integrating Rust

Covering these topics will enable us to avoid pitfalls when building bigger packages that
are more complex. We will also be able to build Rust solutions for smaller projects faster as
we will learn that we do not have to rely on Python setup tools and installation with pip.

Keeping our Rust implementation simple by
piping data to and from Rust
We have covered everything we need to integrate Rust into our Python system. We
can build Rust packages that can be installed using pip and use them in Docker when
integrating with a web application. However, reaching for a setup tool can be too much
effort if the problem being solved is small and simple. For instance, if in a situation we
were merely opening a comma-separated values (CSV) file full of numbers in Python,
calculating the Fibonacci numbers, and then writing them in another file, then it would
make sense to just write the program in Rust. However, we do not start building a Rust
package with Python setup tools if we have a more complicated Python standalone script
that just needs a simple speedup with Rust—it is still just a standalone script. Instead, we
pipe data. This means we pass data from a Python script to a Rust standalone binary and
back to a Python script for computing Fibonacci numbers, as shown here:

Figure 11.1 – Process of a basic pipeline

To achieve the same speed as the Rust Fibonacci calculation package without having to
use any setup tools, we must carry out the following steps:

1.  Build a Python script that formulates the numbers for calculation.

2.  Build a Rust file that accepts the numbers, calculates the Fibonacci numbers, and

returns the calculated numbers.

3.  Build another Python script that accepts the calculated numbers and prints them out.

Keeping our Rust implementation simple by piping data to and from Rust     329

With this, we will be able to have a simple pipeline. While each file is isolated and we can
build in any order, it makes sense to start with Step 1.

Building a Python script that formulates the numbers
for calculation
For this example, we will just hardcode the input numbers that we are passing into our
pipeline, but nothing is stopping you from reading your data from files or taking in
numbers from command-line arguments. In our input.py file, we can write to stdout
with the following code:

import sys

sys.stdout.write("5\n")
sys.stdout.write("6\n")
sys.stdout.write("7\n")
sys.stdout.write("8\n")
sys.stdout.write("9\n")
sys.stdout.write("10\n")

With this, if we run this script with the Python interpreter, we get the following output:

$ python input.py
5
6
7
8
9
10

With this, we can now move on to the next step.

330     Best Practices for Integrating Rust

Building a Rust file that accepts the numbers,
calculates the Fibonacci numbers, and returns the
calculated numbers
For our Rust file, we must have everything contained in the file to keep it as simple as
possible. We can span it over multiple files if needed, but for a simple calculation, keeping
it all in one file is good enough. In our fib.rs file, we initially import what we need and
define our Fibonacci function with the following code:

use std::io;
use std::io::prelude::*;

pub fn fibonacci_reccursive(n: i32) -> u64 {
    match n {
         1 | 2 => 1,
         _     => fibonacci_reccursive(n - 1) +
                  fibonacci_reccursive(n - 2)
    }
}

Here, we can see that there is nothing new; we are merely going to use std::io to get
the numbers piped into the file, and then calculate the Fibonacci number, sending it to the
next file in the pipeline with the following main function:

fn main() {
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    let stdout = std::io::stdout();
    let mut writer = stdout.lock();

    for line in stdin.lock().lines() {
        let input_int: i32 = line.unwrap().parse::<i32>() \
          .unwrap();
        let fib_number = fibonacci_reccursive(input_int);
        writeln!(writer, "{}", fib_number);
    }
}

Keeping our Rust implementation simple by piping data to and from Rust     331

Here, we can see that we define stdin to receive the numbers sent to the Rust program,
and stdout to send out the calculated Fibonacci numbers. We then loop through the
lines sent into the Rust program and then parse each line at an integer. We then calculate
the Fibonacci number and then send it using the macro that we imported with the io
prelude. With this, we can now compile our Rust file with the following command:

rustc fib.rs

This will compile our Rust file. We can now run both files, piping the data from the
Python file to the compiled Rust code with the following command:

$ python input.py | ./fib
5
8
13
21
34
55

Here, we can see that the numbers from the python input.py command get piped
into the Rust code returning the calculated Fibonacci numbers. With this, we can now
move on to the final step, where we get the calculated Fibonacci numbers from the Rust
code and print them out.

Building another Python script that accepts the
calculated numbers and prints them out
Our output.py file is very straightforward. It takes the following form:

import sys

for i in sys.stdin.readlines():
    try:
        processed_number = int(i)
        print(f"receiving: {processed_number}")
    except ValueError:
        pass

332     Best Practices for Integrating Rust

We have a try block because the start and the end of the data passed into the last Python
script will have empty lines, and they will fail when we try to convert them into integers.
We then print out the data with "receiving: {processed_number}" added to the
last script to make it clear that it is the output.py file printing out the numbers. This
gives us the printout, as follows:

$ python input.py | ./fib | python output.py
receiving: 5
receiving: 8
receiving: 13
receiving: 21
receiving: 34
receiving: 55

We can time how long it takes for the pipeline to run using the time command. If we
compare this to pure Python with the example numbers that we have used, pure Python
will be faster. However, we know that Rust is much faster than pure Python code. Because
the input/output (I/O) operations take time, it is not worth implementing the pipeline if
you are going to calculate one or two small numbers. However, to demonstrate the value
of our approach, we can write the following pure Python code in the pure_python.py
file:

def recur_fib(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return (recur_fib(n - 1) +
                recur_fib(n - 2))

for i in [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]:
    print(recur_fib(i))

This gives us the following printout:

$ time python pure_python.py
5
8
13
21

real  0m0.315s
user  0m0.240s
sys  0m0.027s

Adding the same numbers to the pipeline gives us the following printout:

$ time python input.py | ./fib | python output.py
receiving: 5
receiving: 8
receiving: 13
receiving: 21
receiving: 34
receiving: 55
receiving: 610

receiving: 75025
receiving: 832040

real  0m0.054s
user  0m0.050s
sys  0m0.025s

Here, we can see that our pipeline is much faster. The gap between Rust and pure Python
will just get larger as the numbers increase and become more numerous. We can see here
that this is a lot easier with fewer moving parts. If our program is simple, then we keep the
construction and use of Rust simple.

334     Best Practices for Integrating Rust

Giving the interface a native feel with objects
Python is an object-oriented language. When we are building our Rust packages, we need
to keep the friction of adoption low. The adoption of Rust packages would be better if we
keep our interfaces as objects. Most Python packages have object interfaces. Calculations
are done with inputs, and the Python object has a range of functions and attributes that
give us the results of those calculations. While we did cover creating classes in Rust with
pyo3 macros in Chapter 6, Working with Python Objects in Rust, in the Constructing our
custom Python objects in Rust section, it is advised that we understand the pros and cons
of doing this. We remember that classes written in Rust are faster. However, the freedom
of inheritance and metaclassing with pure Python is useful. As a result, it is best to leave
the construction and organization of the object interface in pure Python. Any calculations
that need to be done can be done in Rust. To demonstrate this, we can use the simple
physics example of a particle's two-dimensional (2D) trajectory, as seen in the following
screenshot:

Figure 11.2 – Simple 2D physics trajectory

Here, we can see that the initial velocity is denoted as V0. The projection on the x axis is
denoted by Vx, and the projection on the y axis is denoted by Vy. The dashed line is the
particle at every point in time. Time here is another dimension. Our equations for each
position in time and the endpoint in time (when it hits the ground) are defined as follows:

𝑦𝑦(𝑡𝑡) =   𝑉𝑉𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 −

2

𝑔𝑔 𝑡𝑡

1
2

𝑥𝑥(𝑡𝑡) =   𝑉𝑉𝑥𝑥𝑡𝑡

Giving the interface a native feel with objects     335

2𝑉𝑉𝑦𝑦
𝑔𝑔

𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 =
Here, g is the constant for gravity. We also want to know the position of the particle at
a certain point in time. We do this by calculating the last point in time, then looping
through all the time points between zero and the last point in time, calculating the x and
y coordinates. All we would need is the initial velocity in x and y. The loop through with
the position calculations would all be done in Rust. The dictionary where all the keys
are all the times and all the values are tuples of x and y is housed in the Python object.
We could write one function that processes all the times and returns a dictionary in Rust
called calculate_coordinates. Using it in our Python class would look like this:

from rust_package import calculate_coordinates

class Particle:
    def __init__(self, v_x, v_y):
        self.co_dict = calculate_coordinates(v_x, v_y)

    def get_position(self, time) -> tuple:
        return self.co_dict[time]
    @property
    def times(self):
        return list(self.co_dict.keys())

The user would just have to import the Particle object, initialize it with the initial
velocity in the x and y coordinates, and then input times to get the coordinates. To plot all
the positions for a particle, we would use our class with the following code:

from . . . import Particle

particle = Particle(20, 30)

x_positions = []
y_positions = []

for t in particle.times:
    x, y = particle.get_position(t)

336     Best Practices for Integrating Rust

    x_positions.append(x)
    y_positions.append(y)

This is intuitive to Python. We have kept all our number crunching in Rust to get that
speed, but we have managed to keep all of our interfaces, including accessing times and
positions in Python. As a result, a developer using this package would not know that
it is written in Rust—they would just appreciate that it is fast. We can drive home the
benefits of keeping the formation and access to data 100% in Python while doing all the
calculations in Rust with metaclassing.

In our particle system, we could load a lot of data for the initial velocities of particles.
As a result, our system would calculate the trajectories for a range of particles that we
load. However, if we load two particles with the same initial velocities, they will both
have the same trajectories. Considering this, it would not make sense for us to calculate
the trajectory for both particles. To avoid this, we do not need to store anything in a file
or database for reference; we just need to implement a flyweight design pattern. This is
where we check the parameters passed into the object. If they are the same as the previous
instance, we just return the previous instance. The flyweight pattern is defined with the
following code:

class FlyWeight(type):

    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        key = str(args[0]) + str(args[1])
        if key not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[key] = super( \
                FlyWeight, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[key]

Here, we can see that we combine the initial velocities to define a key, and then check to
see if there is already an instance with these velocities. If there is, we return the instance
from our _instances dictionary. If not, we create a new instance and insert it into our
_instances dictionary. Our particles will then take the form of the following code:

class Particle(metaclass=FlyWeight):

    def __init__(self, v_x, v_y):
        self.co_dict = calculate_coordinates(v_x, v_y)

Giving the interface a native feel with objects     337

    def get_position(self, time) -> tuple:
        return self.co_dict[time]

    @property
    def times(self):
        return list(self.co_dict.keys())

Here, our particles will now adhere to the flyweight pattern. We can test this with the
following code:

test = Particle(4, 6)
test_two = Particle(3, 8)
test_three = Particle(4, 6)

print(id(test))
print(id(test_three))
print(id(test_two))

Running this will give us the following printout:

140579826787152
140579826787152
140579826787280

Here, we can see that the two particles that have the same initial velocities have the same
memory address, so it works.

We can initialize these particles anywhere and this design pattern will apply, ensuring
that we do not perform duplicate calculations. Considering that we are writing Python
extensions in Rust, the flyweight pattern really shows us how much control we get with
how the interface is called, used, and displayed. Even though we have built our interfaces
in Python, this does not mean that we do not have to structure our Rust code. This brings
us on to the next section, in which we discuss how to lean into traits as opposed to objects
when it comes to structuring our Rust code.

338     Best Practices for Integrating Rust

Using traits as opposed to objects
As a Python developer, it is tempting to build structs that inherit via the composition
of other structs. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is well supported in Python;
however, there are many reasons why Rust is favored, and one of them is traits. As seen in
the following screenshot, traits enable us to separate data from behavior:

Figure 11.3 – Difference between traits and objects

This gives us a lot of flexibility as the data and behavior are decoupled, enabling us to slot
behavior in and out of structs as we need. Structs can have a portfolio of traits without
giving us disadvantages arising from multiple inheritance. To demonstrate this, we are
going to create a basic doctor, patient, nurse program so that we can see how different
structs can have different traits, allowing them to move through functions. We are going
to see how traits affect the way we lay out code over multiple files. Our program will have
the following layout:

├── Cargo.toml
├── src
│   ├── actions.rs
│   ├── main.rs
│   ├── objects.rs
│   ├── people.rs
│   └── traits.rs

With this structure, the flow of our code will take the following form:

Giving the interface a native feel with objects     339

Figure 11.4 – Code flow of a simple trait-based program

With this, we can see that our code is decoupled. Our traits go into all the other files
to define the behavior of those files. To build this program, we must carry out the
following steps:

•  Defining traits—building traits for our structs

•  Defining struct behavior with traits

•  Passing traits through functions

•  Storing structs with common traits

•  Running our program in the main.rs file.

With this, we can start by defining our traits in the first subsection.

Defining traits
Before we start defining traits, we must conceptualize the types of people in our program
that we are defining behavior for. They are laid out as follows:

•  Patient: This person does not have any clinical skills, but actions are performed

on them.

•  Nurse: This person has clinical skills but cannot prescribe or diagnose.

•  Nurse practitioner: This person has clinical skills and can prescribe but

cannot diagnose.

340     Best Practices for Integrating Rust

•  Advanced nurse practitioner: This person has clinical skills and can prescribe

and diagnose.

•  Doctor: This person has clinical skills and can prescribe and diagnose.

What we can see here is that they are all humans. Therefore, they are all able to speak and
introduce themselves. So, in our traits.rs file, we can create a Speak trait with the
following code:

pub trait Speak {
    fn introduce(&self) -> ();
}

If a struct implements this trait, it will have to create its own introduce function with
the same return and input parameters. We can also see that everyone apart from the
patient has clinical skills. To accommodate this, we can implement a clinical skills trait
with the following code:

pub trait ClinicalSkills {
    fn can_prescribe(&self) -> bool {
        return false
    }
    fn can_diagnose(&self) -> bool {
        return false
    }
    fn can_administer_medication(&self) -> bool {
        return true
    }
}

Here, we can see that we have defined the most common attributes for each clinician.
Only two people—the doctor and the advanced nurse practitioner—can diagnose and
prescribe. However, all of them can administer medication. We can implement this trait
for all clinicians and then overwrite specifics. We must note that because the doctor
and advanced nurse practitioner have the same possibilities in terms of diagnosing and
prescribing, we can create another trait for this to prevent repeating ourselves, and a trait
for the patient with the following code:

pub trait AdvancedMedical {}
pub trait PatientRole {

Giving the interface a native feel with objects     341

    fn get_name(&self) -> String;
}

We have now defined all the traits that we need. We can start using them to define our
people in the next subsection.

Defining struct behavior with traits
Before we define any structs, we must import our traits into our people.rs file with the
following code:

use super::traits;
use traits::{Speak, ClinicalSkills, AdvancedMedical, \
  PatientRole};

We now have all our traits, so we can define our people in the program with the following
code:

pub struct Patient {
    pub name: String
}
pub struct Nurse {
    pub name: String
}
pub struct NursePractitioner {
    pub name: String
}
pub struct AdvancedNursePractitioner {
    pub name: String
}
pub struct Doctor {
    pub name: String
}

342     Best Practices for Integrating Rust

Sadly, there is some repetition here. This is also going to happen with our Speak trait;
however, it is important to keep these structs separate as we will slot traits into them later,
so we need them to be decoupled. We can implement our Speak trait for each person
with the following code:

impl Speak for Patient {
    fn introduce(&self) {
        println!("hello I'm a Patient and my name is {}", \
            self.name);
    }
}
impl Speak for Nurse {
    fn introduce(&self) {
        println!("hello I'm a Nurse and my name is {}", \
            self.name);
    }
}
impl Speak for NursePractitioner {
    fn introduce(&self) {
        println!("hello I'm a Practitioner and my name is \
            {}", self.name);
    }
}
. . .

We can continue this pattern and implement Speak traits for all the people structs. Now
this is done, we can implement our clinical skills and patient role traits for our people with
the following code:

impl PatientRole for Patient {
    fn get_name(&self) -> String {
        return self.name.clone()

impl ClinicalSkills for NursePractitioner {
    fn can_prescribe(&self) -> bool {

Giving the interface a native feel with objects     343

        return true
    }
}

Here, we can see that our people structs have the following traits:

•  The Patient struct has the standard PatientRole trait.

•  The Nurse struct has the standard ClinicalSkills trait.

•  The NursePractitioner struct has the standard ClinicialSkills trait with

the can_prescribe function overwritten to return true.

Now that we have our clinical skills applied to our standard clinicians, we can now apply
our advanced traits with the following code:

impl AdvancedMedical for AdvancedNursePractitioner {}
impl AdvancedMedical for Doctor {}

impl<T> ClinicalSkills for T where T: AdvancedMedical {
    fn can_prescribe(&self) -> bool {
        return true
    }
    fn can_diagnose(&self) -> bool {
        return true
    }
}

Here, we apply the AdvancedMedical trait to our Doctor and
AdvancedNursePractitioner structs. However, we know that these structs
are also clinicians. We need them to have clinical skills. Therefore, we implement
ClinicalSkills for the AdvancedMedical trait. We then overwrite the
can_prescribe and can_diagnose functions to true. Therefore, doctors and
advanced nurse practitioners have both ClinicalSkills and AdvancedMedical
traits and can diagnose and prescribe. With this, our people structs are ready to be passed
into functions. We will do this in the next subsection.

344     Best Practices for Integrating Rust

Passing traits through functions
To perform actions such as updating a database or sending data to a server, we are going
to pass our people structs through functions where clinicians can act on patients. To do
this, we must import our traits in our actions.rs file with the following code:

use super::traits;
use traits::{ClinicalSkills, AdvancedMedical, PatientRole};

Our first action is to admit a patient. This can be done by anyone with clinical skills.
Considering this, we can define this action with the following code:

pub fn admit_patient<Y: ClinicalSkills>(
    patient: &Box<dyn PatientRole>, _clinician: &Y) {
    println!("{} is being admitted", patient.get_name());
}

Here, we can see that our clinician being passed in is anything with a ClinicalSkills
trait, which means all our clinician structs. However, it must be noted that we are also
passing in &Box<dyn PatientRole> for the patient. This is because we will be using a
patient list when passing in patients. We can have multiple patients assigned to a clinician.
We will explore why we are using &Box<dyn PatientRole> in the next subsection
when we define our patient list struct. The next action is to diagnose a patient, which is
defined with the following code:

pub fn diagnose_patient<Y: AdvancedMedical>(
    patient: &Box<dyn PatientRole>, _clinician: &Y) {
    println!("{} is being diagnosed", patient.get_name());
}

Here, it makes sense to have the AdvancedMedical trait to diagnose. If we try to pass
in a Nurse or NursePractitioner struct, the program will fail to compile due to
mismatching traits. We can then have a prescribe medication action, which takes the form
of the following code:

pub fn prescribe_meds<Y: ClinicalSkills>(
    patient: &Box<dyn PatientRole>, clinician: &Y) {
    if clinician.can_prescribe() {
        println!("{} is being prescribed medication", \
          patient.get_name());
    } else {

Giving the interface a native feel with objects     345

        panic!("clinician cannot prescribe medication");
    }
}

Here, we can see that the ClinicalSkills trait is accepted but the code will throw
an error if the clinician cannot prescribe. This is because our NursePractitioner
struct can prescribe. We could also make a third intermediate trait and apply it to doctor,
advanced, and normal nurse practitioners. However, this is just one check as opposed
to implementing a new trait for all three clinician structs. Our last action is that of
administering medication and discharging the patient, which can be done by all our
clinician structs; therefore, it takes the following form:

pub fn administer_meds<Y: ClinicalSkills>(
    patient: &Box<dyn PatientRole>, _clinician: &Y) {
    println!("{} is having meds administered", \
      patient.get_name());
}
pub fn discharge_patient<Y: ClinicalSkills>(
    patient: &Box<dyn PatientRole>, _clinician: &Y) {
    println!("{} is being discharged", patient.get_name());
}

We can now pass our people structs through a range of actions, with our compiler
refusing to compile if we pass through the wrong person struct into the function. In the
next subsection, we will be storing structs with traits in a patient list.

Storing structs with common traits
When it comes to a patient list, it is tempting to just store patient structs in a vector.
However, this does not give us much flexibility. For instance, let's say that our system is
deployed, and one of the nurses in the hospital is sick and must be admitted. We could
allow this by implementing the PatientRole trait to the Nurse struct without having
to rewrite anything else. We might also need to expand the different types of patients,
adding more structs such as ShortStayPatient, or CriticallySickPatient.
Because of this, we store our patients with the PatientRole trait in our objects.rs
file with the following code:

use super::traits;
use traits::PatientRole;

346     Best Practices for Integrating Rust

pub struct PatientList {
    pub patients: Vec<Box<dyn PatientRole>>
}

We must wrap our structs in a box because we do not know the size at compile time.
Different structs of different sizes can implement the same trait. A Box is a pointer on the
heap memory. Because we know the size of pointers, we know the size of memory being
added to the vector at compile time. The dyn keyword is used to define that it is a trait
that we are referring to. Managing to access the struct directly in the patients vector
is not going to happen, as again, we do not know the size of the struct. Therefore, we
access the data of the struct via the get_name function in the PatientRole trait in
our action functions. Traits are also pointers. We can still build functions such as
constructors for our struct. However, when it comes to our Patient struct being passed
through an action function that we created, our PatientRole trait acts as an interface
between our Patient struct and our admit_function function. We now have
everything we need, so we can move on to our next subsection to put it all together and
run it in our main.rs file.

Running our traits in the main file
Running all our code together is straightforward and safe. Here's what we need to do:

1.  First, we import all we need in our main.rs file with the following code:

mod traits;
mod objects;
mod people;
mod actions;

use people::{Patient, Nurse, Doctor};
use objects::PatientList;
use actions::{admit_patient, diagnose_patient, \
  prescribe_meds, administer_meds, discharge_patient};

2.

In our main function, we can now define the two nurses and doctors for our clinic
for the day with the following code:

fn main() {
    let doctor = Doctor{name: String::from("Torath")};
    let doctor_two = Doctor{name: \
      String::from("Sergio")};

Giving the interface a native feel with objects     347

    let nurse = Nurse{name: String::from("Maxwell")};
    let nurse_two = Nurse{name: \
      String::from("Nathan")};
}

3.  We then get our patient list, and it turns out that the four horsemen have turned up

for their treatment, as seen in the following code snippet:

    let patient_list = PatientList {
        patients: vec![
            Box::new(Patient{name: \
              String::from("pestilence")}),
            Box::new(Patient{name: \
              String::from("war")}),
            Box::new(Patient{name: \
              String::from("famine")}),
            Box::new(Patient{name: \
              String::from("death")})
        ]
    };

4.  We then loop through our patients, getting our doctors and nurses to care for them

with the following code:

    for i in patient_list.patients {
        admit_patient(&i, &nurse);
        diagnose_patient(&i, &doctor);
        prescribe_meds(&i, &doctor_two);
        administer_meds(&i, &nurse_two);
        discharge_patient(&i, &nurse);
    }

This is the end of our main function. Running it would give us the following printout:

conquest is being admitted
conquest is being diagnosed
conquest is being prescribed medication
conquest is having meds administered
conquest is being discharged

348     Best Practices for Integrating Rust

war is being admitted
. . .
famine is being admitted
. . .
death is being admitted
. . .

With this, we have finished our exercise in using traits in Rust. Hopefully, with this, you
see the flexibility and decoupling we get when we use traits. However, we must remember
that this approach cannot be supported if we were to build an interface with our Python
system. If we were to build an interface, this could be done with the following pseudocode:

#[pyclass]
pub struct NurseClass {
    #[pyo3(get, set)]
    pub name: String,
    #[pyo3(get, set)]
    pub admin: bool,
    #[pyo3(get, set)]
    pub prescribe: bool,
    #[pyo3(get, set)]
    pub diagnose: bool,
}
#[pymethods]
impl NurseClass {
    #[new]
    fn new(name: String, admin: bool, prescribe: bool,
           diagnose: bool)      Self {
        return Nurse{name, admin, prescribe}
    }
    fn introduce(&self)      Vec<Vec<u64>> {
        println!("hello I'm a Nurse and my name is {}",
                 self.name);
    }
}

Keeping data-parallelism simple with Rayon     349

Here, we can see that we swapped the functions in the ClinicalSkills trait for
attributes. We would be able to pass our NurseClass struct with traits into a function
which calls the ClinicalSkills functions. The results from the ClinicalSkills
functions can then be passed into the constructor for our NurseClass struct. Our
NurseClass struct can then be passed out to our Python system.

OOP has its merits and should be used when coding in Python. However, Rust has given
us a new approach that is flexible and decoupled. It may take a while to get your head
around traits, however, they are worth it. It's advised that you keep working with traits in
your Rust code to get the advantages of using traits.

Keeping data-parallelism simple with Rayon
In Chapter 3, Understanding Concurrency we processed our Fibonacci numbers in
parallel. While it was interesting to look into concurrency, when we are building our own
applications, we should lean on other crates to reduce the complexity of our application.
This is where the rayon crate comes in. This will enable us to loop through numbers to
be calculated and process them in parallel. In order to do this, we initially have to define
the crate in the Cargo.toml file as seen here:

[dependencies]
rayon = "1.5.1"
With this, we import this crate in our main.rs file with the
following code:
extern crate rayon;
use rayon::prelude::*;

Then, if we do not import the macros with use rayon::prelude::*; our compiler
will refuse to compile when we try and turn a standard vector into a parallel iterator. With
these macros, we can execute parallel Fibonacci calculations with the following code:

pub fn fibonacci_reccursive(n: i32) -> u64 {
      match n {
            1 | 2 => 1,
      _     => fibonacci_reccursive(n - 1) +
                   fibonacci_reccursive(n - 2)
      }
}
fn main() {
    let numbers: Vec<u64> = vec![6, 7, 8, 9, 10].into_par_iter(

350     Best Practices for Integrating Rust

    ).map(
        |x| fibonacci_reccursive(x)
    ).collect();
    println!("{:?}", numbers);
}

With this code, we can see that we define a standard Fibonacci number function. We then
get a vector of input numbers and convert it into a parallel iterator with the into_par_
iter function. We then map our Fibonacci function to this parallel iterator. After this, we
collect the results. Therefore, printing numbers will give us [8, 13, 21, 34, 55].
And that's it! We have coded parallel code, and we have kept it simple with the rayon
crate. However, we must remember that there is a cost to set up this parallelization. If
we were only going to use the numbers in the example, a normal loop would be faster.
However, if the numbers and size of the array increase, the benefits of rayon start to
show. For instance, if we were to have a vector of numbers to be calculated ranging from
6 to 33, we will get the time difference as seen in the following figure:

Figure 11.5 – Time taken for a loop 6 -> 33 Fib numbers to be taken in microseconds
[left = Rayon right = normal loop]

Further reading     351

With this, we have a simple approach to parallelizing our calculations which will keep our
complexity and mistakes down.

Summary
In this chapter, we went over best practices for implementing Rust in our Python systems.
We initially started by keeping it simple. We saw that we could leverage the speed of Rust
without any setup tools or installing a package thanks to piping data to and from our Rust
binary with Python. This is a useful technique to have and is not just limited to Python
and Rust. In fact, you can pipe data between any language.

If you are writing a basic program, then data piping should be the first thing you should
do. This way, you reduce the number of moving parts and speed up development. A
simple Bash script could compile the Rust file and run the process. However, as the
program complexity increases, you can go for setup tools and import your Rust code
directly into your Python code, utilizing what you covered in this book.

We then moved on to the importance of leveraging Python's object support with a
metaclass to lean on Python for our interfaces without Rust packages. Python is a mature
language that is very expressive. It makes sense to use the best of Python and the best
of Rust when building our packages by using Python for the interfaces and Rust for the
calculations. We finally covered how to utilize traits as opposed to forcing Rust to have
an object-orientated approach with inheritance via composition. The result is more
decoupling and flexibility. Finally, we kept our parallel processing code simple with
third-party crates which will increase our productivity and reduce the complexity of
our code, and in turn, reduce mistakes.

We have now come to the end of the book. There is always more to learn; however, you
now have a full tool belt. You not only have a handle on the fastest memory-safe language
that is cutting-edge, but you can also fuse it with the widely used Python language in an
efficient way, installing it with pip. Not only can you do this for Python scripts, but you
can also wrap up Rust extensions in Docker, enabling you to use Rust in Python web
applications. Therefore, you do not have to wait for your company and projects to rewrite
and adopt Rust. Instead, you can plug Rust into an already established project tomorrow.
I am nothing short of excited about what you will do with this in the future.
